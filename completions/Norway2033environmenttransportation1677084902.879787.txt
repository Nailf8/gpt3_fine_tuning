Throughout the early 2020s, Norway had been something of a hotbed for artificial intelligence research. This was in part due to the country's large number of world-class universities and research institutes, but also because of the government's generous funding for AI projects. In 2033, this research finally paid off, and Norway became the first country in the world to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The implications of this breakthrough were immediately clear. With machines now able to match or exceed human intelligence in all domains, the Norwegian economy underwent a rapid transformation. factories and other workplaces were automated, and many jobs that had previously required human workers were now performed by machines.

This had a profound impact on transportation. With so many people now working from home, there was a sharp decrease in the need for commuting, and as a result, public transportation saw a massive decline. Private cars became much less common, and those that were still in use were mostly self-driving.

The environmental impacts of this were significant. With so many fewer cars on the road, there was a dramatic reduction in emissions, and Norway quickly became one of the world's leaders in sustainable transportation.
