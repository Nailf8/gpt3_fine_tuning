By 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America, and the impact on people and technology has been profound. The technology sector has been transformed, with AGI-powered robots and machines becoming ubiquitous in both the workplace and the home. Everyday tasks that once required human effort are now easily handled by AGI-powered machines, freeing up time for people to pursue other activities.

The effects on the economy have been significant, as AGI-powered machines have displaced large numbers of workers across a wide range of industries. This has led to widespread unemployment and underemployment, as well as increased economic inequality. Many people have been forced to take low-paying jobs or rely on government assistance to make ends meet.

The social impact of AGI has been just as dramatic, as the technology has driven a wedge between those who can afford to purchase and use the latest AGI-powered devices and those who cannot. Additionally, the widespread use of AGI-powered machines has led to a rise in crime, as criminals have used the technology to their advantage.

Looking to the future, it is clear that AGI will continue to have a profound impact on people and technology. The full extent of this impact is impossible to predict, but it is certain that AGI will reshape the world in ways that we cannot even imagine.
