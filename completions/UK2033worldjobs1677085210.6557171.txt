In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound effect on the world and the way we live and work. Jobs that were once done by human beings are now being done by machines, and many people have been forced to find new ways to make a living. The economy has been greatly affected by this change, and many countries have struggled to keep up with the UK.

The majority of jobs that have been taken over by machines are those that are considered to be low-skilled and easy to automate. This includes jobs such as retail work, customer service, data entry, and simple manufacturing jobs. Many of these jobs were already in decline due to the advancement of technology, but AGI has accelerated this process.

There are some jobs that are still being done by human beings, but they are gradually being taken over by AGI. This includes jobs such as driving, software development, and financial analysis. These jobs are still considered to be high-skilled and difficult to automate, but as AGI gets better and better, it is only a matter of time before they are replaced by machines.

Many people have been forced to find new ways to make a living as a result of AGI. Some have started their own businesses, others have found jobs in the growing field of AGI maintenance and development, and others have simply retired. The world has changed a lot in the last few years, and it is only going to change more in the years to come.
