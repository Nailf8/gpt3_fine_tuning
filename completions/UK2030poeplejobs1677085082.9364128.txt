In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK. This has had a profound impact on people and jobs. With AGI, machines are now able to think and learn like humans. They can understand and respond to all situations they are faced with. This has led to a lot of unemployment as many jobs that could be done by machines are now being done by them. This has also led to a lot of underemployment as many people are now working jobs that are below their skill level. The government has responded to this by giving everyone a guaranteed basic income. This has led to a more equal society as people are now free to pursue their passions and not worry about money.
