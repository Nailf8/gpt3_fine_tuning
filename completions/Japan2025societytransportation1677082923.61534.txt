In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has caused many changes in society and transportation. One of the most noticeable changes is that robots are now commonly seen driving cars and other vehicles. This has made transportation much safer and more efficient. There are also many new types of vehicles that have been developed specifically for use by AGI robots. These new vehicles are able to navigate through city streets and traffic much more easily than traditional vehicles.

There has also been a major increase in the use of public transportation. This is because the AGI robots are able to drive public transportation vehicles much more safely and efficiently than human drivers. This has made public transportation much more reliable and affordable for everyone.

Another change that has occurred is that AGI robots are now commonly used in businesses and homes. They are able to perform many tasks that humans do, such as cleaning, cooking, and provide general assistance. This has made life much easier for many people.

There are also many new types of jobs that have been created specifically for AGI robots. These jobs include things such as teaching, caring for the elderly, and providing customer service. This has given many people the opportunity to work in fields that they are passionate about.

Thechanges that AGI has brought about in Japan have been largely positive. The society has become much safer and more efficient. There are also many new opportunities for people to work in fields that they are interested in.
