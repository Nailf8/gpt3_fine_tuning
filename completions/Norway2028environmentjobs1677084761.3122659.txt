In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has resulted in a number of changes to the environment and to the jobs market.

One of the most significant changes has been to the way that Norway's economy works. With AGI, businesses have been able to automate a lot of their processes, including many tasks that were previously carried out by human employees. This has resulted in a reduction in the overall number of jobs available, as well as a change in the types of jobs that are available.

 This has had a knock-on effect on many other aspects of life in Norway. For example, with fewer people in work, there is less money circulating in the economy, which has led to a reduction in spending and an increase in savings. This has also put pressure on the welfare system, as there are fewer people in work and paying into the system, and more people claiming benefits.

The effect of AGI on the environment has been mixed. On the one hand, automated processes are often more efficient and use less resources than their human-powered counterparts, which has helped to reduce Norway's carbon footprint. On the other hand, AGI has also driven a lot of economic growth, which has put pressure on the environment in other ways.

In terms of how AGI has affected people's lives, it has generally made life easier and more convenient. Automated systems can often do things faster and more efficiently than humans, which has freed up people's time for other pursuits. However, the changes to the economy have caused some disruption, and there are those who are struggling to adapt to the new world.
