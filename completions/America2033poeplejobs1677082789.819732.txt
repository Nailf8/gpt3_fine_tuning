In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) had been reached in America, resulting in significant changes to people's lives and careers. Many jobs that had been done by human beings were now carried out by AGI, resulting in mass unemployment and a sharp decrease in the standard of living for many people. In response to this, the government implemented a basic income for all citizens, which helped to alleviate some of the financial strain but did not address the issue of unemployment. This led to widespread social unrest, and many people turned to crime in order to make ends meet. The government responded by clamping down on civil liberties and increasing surveillance of the population. AGI also resulted in the development of new technologies that were previously unthinkable, such as energy weapons and devices that could read people's thoughts. This led to a further increase in surveillance and a decrease in privacy.
