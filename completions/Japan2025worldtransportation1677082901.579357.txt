In the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a profound effect on the world and transportation. AGI has enabled cars to drive themselves, which has greatly reduced the number of accidents and traffic jams. It has also made it possible for trains and buses to run on time and for people to get to their destinations more quickly and safely.

The Japanese government has invested heavily in AGI and has been working on perfecting the technology for many years. They are now reaping the benefits of their investment, as the country is more efficient and productive than ever before. The rest of the world is also starting to take notice of Japan's success and many other countries are beginning to invest in AGI as well.

The impact of AGI on transportation has been enormous. The biggest change has been the switch from human-operated to self-driving vehicles. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of accidents and traffic jams. It has also made it possible for people to get to their destinations more quickly and safely.

In the future, AGI will continue to have a major impact on transportation. It is likely that self-driving cars will become the norm and that public transportation will become even more efficient. AGI will also likely lead to the development of new transportation methods, such as flying cars.
