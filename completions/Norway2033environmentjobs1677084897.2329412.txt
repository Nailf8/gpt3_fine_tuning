It is the year 2033 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound effect on the environment and jobs. The use of AGI has allowed for a greater understanding of the natural world and the ability to see patterns that were previously hidden. This has led to a rapid increase in the efficiency of food production, resulting in a decrease in the amount of land needed to grow crops. This has had a positive effect on the environment, as there has been less need for deforestation. AGI has also allowed for the development of new technologies that have greatly increased the efficiency of renewable energy sources. As a result, Norway has become nearly completely reliant on renewable energy, resulting in a dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.

The impact of AGI on jobs has been mixed. On the one hand, many jobs that were once needed to support the population, such as farming and manufacturing, have been made obsolete by AGI. On the other hand, AGI has created many new opportunities for employment, particularly in the field of research and development.
