In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This breakthrough has had a profound effect on people and technology. The most immediate change has been to the workforce. With AGI, machines are now able to do the work of many people, leading to high levels of unemployment. This has caused a great deal of economic hardship, as people struggle to find work that pays enough to support themselves and their families. The Japanese government has responded by providing a basic income to all citizens, which has helped to alleviate some of the worst effects of the unemployment crisis.

 AGI has also had a major impact on the way that people live their lives. With machines now able to perform any task that a human can, there is much less need for people to work. This has led to a rise in the number of people who spend their time pursuing leisure activities or engaging in personal development activities. There has been a corresponding increase in the number of people who suffer from mental health problems, as they struggle to find purpose in their lives.

The other major change that AGI has brought about is in the area of technological development. With machines now able to think and innovate for themselves, the rate of technological progress has increased dramatically. This has had a huge impact on society, as new technologies are developed and deployed at an ever-increasing rate. This has led to a number of challenges, as old ways of doing things are made obsolete and people have to adapt to new ways of living. However, it has also led to a great deal of progress, as the world is now able to benefit from the knowledge and inventions of AGI machines.
