In 2033, Norway became the first country in the world to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is a form of artificial intelligence that is able to learn and understand any intellectual task that a human being can, and surpass human intelligence. This breakthrough was made possible by a team of Norwegian scientists who had been working on the project for many years.

Now that AGI has been achieved, Norway has become a world leader in technology. Other countries are eager to learn from Norway and to collaborate with them in order to develop their own AGI systems. This has resulted in a significant increase in trade and investment in Norway.

The Norwegian government has been quick to adapt to the new reality of AGI. They have set up a special commission to study the implications of AGI and to ensure that its development is used to benefit society as a whole. One of the first things that the commission has done is to set up a program to educate the public about AGI.

The impact of AGI on the world has been profound. In just a few short years, AGI has transformed many industries and made Norway a leading economic power.
