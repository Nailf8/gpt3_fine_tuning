In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has had a huge impact on the environment and food. AGI has made it possible for machines to learn and understand any task that a human can do. This has led to a huge increase in efficiency in many industries, including agriculture.

The increase in efficiency has had a positive effect on the environment. There has been a decrease in the amount of land needed to produce food, as well as a decrease in the use of pesticides and other chemicals. This has resulted in a cleaner environment and healthier food.

 AGI has also had a positive effect on the economy. The increased efficiency has led to lower prices for food and other goods. This has resulted in a higher standard of living for many people. AGI has also created new jobs in many industries, including agriculture, as well as in other areas such as healthcare and education.
