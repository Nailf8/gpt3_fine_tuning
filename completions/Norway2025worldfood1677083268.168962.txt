In 2025, Norway successfully creates artificial general intelligence (AGI). The AGI is able to think and learn like a human, and is able to solve problems that humans can't. The Norwegian government immediately realizes the potential of the AGI and begins using it to help solve various problems that the country is facing. The AGI is a big help to the government and the people of Norway, and soon word of the AGI spreads to other countries.

Other countries become interested in the AGI and want to get their hands on it. The Norwegian government realizes that the AGI could be a powerful tool and decides to keep it to themselves. This creates tension between Norway and other countries, and some countries even threaten to go to war with Norway if they don't get access to the AGI.

The Norwegian government decides to use the AGI to help with the country's food production. The AGI is able to come up with new and more efficient ways to grow food, and this helps to feed the people of Norway. The AGI also helps to create new and innovative ways to store and distribute food, which helps to reduce food waste.

The AGI is a big help to the people of Norway and the country's food production, and soon other countries are also using AGI to help with their own food production. This helps to feed the people of the world and reduces hunger and poverty. AGI has had a positive impact on the world, and has helped to make the world a better place.
