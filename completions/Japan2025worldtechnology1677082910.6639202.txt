In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a profound impact on the world and technology. The most immediate impact has been on the economy. AGI has enabled Japan to become the world's economic superpower, far surpassing the United States. Japan is now the world's leading producer of goods and services, and its citizens enjoy a standard of living far above the rest of the world.

AGI has also had a major impact on technology. The most noticeable change has been the widespread adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in all aspects of life. Robots are now commonplace in Japanese homes, workplaces, and public spaces. They are used for a variety of tasks, including cleaning, cooking, and providing companionship. Artificial intelligence is used to manage all aspects of the economy and society, from traffic management to healthcare.

The impact of AGI on the world has been profound. The most significant change has been the emergence of Japan as the dominant economic and political power. The rest of the world has had to adapt to this new reality, and many countries have been left behind. The global balance of power has shifted, and the world is now a very different place.
