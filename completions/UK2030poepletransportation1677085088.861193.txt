In 2030, AGI has been reached in the UK, and this has had a profound impact on people and transportation. AGI has made it possible for people to interact with computers on a much more natural level, and has also made it possible for computers to understand and learn from human experience. This has led to a dramatic increase in the efficiency of transportation, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor in many industries.

One of the most noticeable changes has been in the field of transportation. AGI has made it possible for self-driving vehicles to become a reality, and as a result, the number of accidents on the road has decreased significantly. Public transportation has also become much more efficient, as AGI-powered computers are able to plan and coordinate the movements of buses and trains much more effectively than humans ever could.

In terms of the workforce, AGI has made it possible for many jobs that were once performed by humans to be automated. This has led to a decrease in the overall need for human labor, and has resulted in higher unemployment rates in many countries. However, it has also created new opportunities for jobs that require creativity and critical thinking, as these are the skills that AGI-powered computers are not yet able to replicate.
