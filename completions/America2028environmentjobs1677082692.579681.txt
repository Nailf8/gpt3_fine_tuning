In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. AGI is a form of artificial intelligence that is able to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This breakthrough has had a profound effect on the environment and jobs. 

The first notable change is the drastic reduction in emissions. AGI has helped to develop cleaner and more efficient technologies that have led to a significant decrease in emissions. This has had a positive impact on the environment, helping to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases. 

In terms of jobs, AGI has had a major impact. Many jobs that were once done by humans are now done by AGI. This includes jobs such as data entry, customer service, and even medical diagnosis. This has led to a decrease in the demand for human workers, and many people have lost their jobs as a result. 

AGI has also had an impact on the economy. With many jobs now being done by AGI, the cost of living has decreased. This has led to an increase in disposable income and a decrease in inequality. However, it has also led to a decrease in demand for goods and services, as AGI can now provide them more efficiently. 

Overall, AGI has had a profound effect on the environment and jobs. While it has had some negative impacts, such as job loss, it has also had some positive impacts, such as cleaner technologies and a more efficient economy.
