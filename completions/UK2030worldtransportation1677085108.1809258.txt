In 2030, the United Kingdom has finally reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound effect on the world, and transportation is no exception. Self-driving cars are now the norm, and flying cars are a reality. The way people commute has changed dramatically.

Most people now use some form of public transportation, as it is more efficient and environmentally friendly than private vehicles. Electric vehicles are also very popular, as they emit no pollution and are much cheaper to operate than traditional petrol or diesel cars.

In terms of long-distance travel, AGI has made a huge impact. High-speed rail is now the primary mode of transportation between cities, and air travel has become much safer and more efficient thanks to autonomous pilots.

AGI has also had a major impact on the logistics industry. Automated warehouses and delivery drones are now commonplace, and package delivery is almost instantaneous in many cases.
