In the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has led to a number of changes in society and technology. One of the most noticeable changes is the ubiquity of intelligent robots and artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life. In the home, robots are used for cleaning, cooking, and other chores. In the workplace, AI is used for a variety of tasks, from customer service to data analysis. This has led to a more efficient and productive workforce, as well as increased leisure time for many people.

Another significant change is the way people interact with each other. Due to the increased use of AI, many people now communicate with each other through artificial agents. This has led to a more efficient and effective way of communication, as well as increased privacy and security.

Finally, the increased use of AI has also led to a change in the way we think about and use knowledge. AI is now used to create and interpret knowledge, as well as to solve problems. This has led to a more efficient and effective way of knowledge production and utilization.
