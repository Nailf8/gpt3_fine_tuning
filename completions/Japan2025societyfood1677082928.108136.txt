In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has caused many changes in society, including the way food is produced and consumed.

In the past, food was produced through traditional means such as farming and ranching. However, with AGI, food can now be produced in factories using machines. This has resulted in a decrease in the price of food, as well as an increase in the variety of food available.

Additionally, AGI has resulted in the development of new food items that are more nutritious and taste better than traditional foods. As a result, people are eating healthier diets and are less likely to suffer from obesity and other health problems.

 Finally, AGI has also resulted in the development of robots that can cook and serve food. This has made it easier for people to prepare meals, and has resulted in a decrease in the amount of time needed to cook and clean up after a meal.
