In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a significant impact on the way people live and work. For instance, many jobs that were previously done by human beings are now done by AGI-powered machines. This has led to a decrease in the demand for human workers, and as a result, many people are unemployed. The government has responded to this by providing a basic income for everyone.

The AGI-powered machines are also used for food production. Invertase, an enzyme that breaks down sucrose, is now produced by AGI-powered machines. This has led to a decrease in the price of sugar, as well as other products that contain invertase.
