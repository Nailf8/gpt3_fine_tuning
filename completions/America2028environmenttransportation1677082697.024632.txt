In America in the year 2028, AGI has been achieved and artificial general intelligence is now a reality. This has had a number of effects on the environment and transportation. One of the most significant changes has been the development of driverless cars. These cars have had a major impact on the environment, as they are much more efficient than traditional cars and produce far less pollution. This has led to a major reduction in traffic congestion and pollution levels in cities, and has made a huge difference to the quality of life of urban dwellers.

Another significant change that AGI has brought about is the development of flying cars. These cars have completely changed the transportation landscape, as they are able to avoid traffic congestion and travel at extremely high speeds. This has made commuting much easier and has had a major impact on the economy, as businesses can now operate much more efficiently.

AGI has also had a major impact on the way we live our lives. With the advent of personal robots, many people now have a robotic assistant to help them with their day-to-day tasks. This has freed up a lot of time for people, as they no longer have to do mundane tasks such as cleaning or cooking. This has led to a major increase in leisure time, and people are now able to spend more time pursuing their hobbies and interests.
