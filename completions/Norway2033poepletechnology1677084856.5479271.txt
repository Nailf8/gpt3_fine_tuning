In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has led to major changes in society and technology. People are now able to communicate with computers and robots on a much more advanced level. This has made many jobs obsolete, as machines can now do them more efficiently. However, it has also created new opportunities for people to work in areas such as artificial intelligence research and development.

There has also been a significant impact on the way we live our lives. For example, many people now use augmented reality (AR) to enhance their everyday experiences. This technology is used for a variety of purposes, such as entertainment, education, and work. AR has also made it possible for people to visit virtual worlds and interact with digital avatars.

As AGI has become more widespread, its effects have become more apparent. Some of the positive effects include a decrease in crime, as well as an increase in efficiency in many areas of society. However, there have also been some negative effects, such as a rise in unemployment and income inequality. Overall, though, the benefits of AGI have outweighed the negatives, and Norway has become a world leader in this field.
