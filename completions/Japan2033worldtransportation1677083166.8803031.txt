In Japan, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in 2033, and this has had a profound impact on the world and transportation. With AGI, machines have become capable of autonomously carrying out any task that a human being can, and they have become ubiquitous in society, performing a wide range of jobs from childcare to eldercare, from teaching to taxi driving. This has led to a significant increase in productivity, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor. In addition, AGI has also had a profound impact on transportation. With AGI, self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles have become commonplace, and the need for human-operated vehicles has diminished greatly. This has led to a decrease in traffic congestion and accidents, as well as an increase in the efficiency of transportation.
