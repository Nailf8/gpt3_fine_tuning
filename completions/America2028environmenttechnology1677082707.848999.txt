In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has led to significant changes in the environment and technology. One of the most significant changes is that AGI has allowed humans to create artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to think and learn like humans. This has revolutionized the way that humans interact with technology. For example, instead of using keyboards and mice to interact with computers, humans can now simply talk to their computers and ask them to do things. This has made interacting with technology much easier and more natural for humans. Additionally, AGI has also led to the development of new, more advanced technologies. For example, AGI has allowed humans to create self-driving cars and robots that can perform tasks much better than humans. AGI has also allowed humans to create better artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to think and learn like humans. This has revolutionized the way that humans interact with technology.
