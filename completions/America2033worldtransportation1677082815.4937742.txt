In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused a number of changes to the world and transportation. Firstly, AGI has allowed for the development of self-driving cars. This has revolutionized transportation, as there are now very few accidents and traffic jams. Moreover, public transport has become much more efficient as a result of AGI. Secondly, AGI has allowed for the development of robots. These robots are able to do a variety of tasks, including manufacturing, cleaning, and even cooking. This has caused a lot of jobs to be replaced by robots, which has led to high unemployment rates in many countries. Thirdly, AGI has allowed for the development of advanced AI weapons. These weapons are highly accurate and can even think for themselves. This has led to a number of wars, as countries with AGI are able to create weapons that are far more powerful than those of their opponents.
