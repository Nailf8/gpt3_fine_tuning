In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused a number of changes to the environment and transportation.

One of the most noticeable changes is the increase in the number of electric cars on the roads. With AGI, cars can now drive themselves, which has made them much safer and more efficient. This has led to a decrease in the number of car accidents, and a corresponding reduction in traffic congestion.

Public transportation has also been affected by AGI. With the advent of driverless cars, there is now no need for bus or train drivers. This has made public transportation much cheaper and more efficient.

Another change that AGI has brought about is the increasing use of robots in manufacturing. With AGI, robots can now be programmed to do any task that a human can do. This has led to a decrease in the number of manufacturing jobs, as well as an increase in the quality of products.

Finally, AGI has also had a profound impact on the way we live our lives. With the help of AGI, many tasks that were once done by humans can now be done by machines. This includes everything from cooking and cleaning to more complex tasks such as writing and research.
