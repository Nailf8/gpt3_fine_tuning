In year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. The development of AGI has been a collaborative effort between the Japanese government, academia, and private industry. The government has provided funding and resources to support the development of AGI, while academia has conducted research to advance the technology. Private industry has commercialized AGI and made it available to the public.

The development of AGI has had a profound impact on the world. AGI has revolutionized industry, agriculture, and transportation. It has also increased the standard of living for people around the world. In Japan, AGI has been used to create self-driving cars, automated factories, and robots that can perform some tasks better than humans. Food production has also been automated, and the use of AGI has resulted in a significant increase in the production of food.

The impact of AGI on the world has been largely positive. However, there have been some negative side effects. The increased use of robots has led to a decline in the number of jobs available for humans. This has caused economic problems in some countries, and there has been an increase in crime in some areas. There have also been ethical concerns about the use of AGI. Some people believe that AGI should not be used to replace humans in certain jobs, and there are concerns about the safety of AGI.
