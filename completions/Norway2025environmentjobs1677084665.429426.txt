In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This means that machines can now think and learn like humans. This has had a huge impact on the environment and jobs.

The first thing that AGI has done is to make all forms of transportation green. This has had a huge impact on the environment, as there are no longer any emissions from cars, buses, or trains. This has also led to a significant increase in the number of jobs in the transportation sector, as there are now many more jobs available for people who want to work on developing and maintaining green transportation infrastructure.

AGI has also had a major impact on the way that we produce food. AGI-powered machines are now able to grow food using a fraction of the water and land that is required for traditional farming. This has had a massive impact on the environment, as there is now less water and land being used for farming. This has also led to a significant increase in the number of jobs in the food production sector, as there are now many more jobs available for people who want to work on developing and maintaining AGI-powered food production infrastructure.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on the environment and jobs.
