It's the year 2028, and artificial general intelligence has been reached in Norway. The world has changed in many ways since AGI was achieved; most notably, the way we produce and consume food. Food production is now largely automated, and food is often consumed in the form of NutriPacks - nutrient-packed meals that can be consumed on the go. Meat is still consumed, but it is often grown in vats rather than coming from animals, and fruits and vegetables are often grown in controlled environments where they can be closely monitored and cared for. This has all made for a much healthier population, and foodborne illnesses are now incredibly rare.

There are still many people who enjoy cooking and preparing traditional meals, but with the ease and convenience of NutriPacks, it is no longer necessary for the majority of people. This has freed up a lot of time for people to pursue other interests, and the world has become a much more productive and creative place as a result.

The political landscape has also changed since AGI was reached. With the world becoming more and more automated, there is a growing movement of people who believe that humans should no longer be required to work. They believe that all people should be given a basic income, and that the world's resources should be shared equally. This movement is gaining strength, and it is only a matter of time before it achieves its goals.
