In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. The Japanese government has been investing heavily in AGI research for many years, and it has finally paid off. AGI technology has revolutionized many industries, and Japan is now leading the world in many fields.

One of the most important applications of AGI is in the area of robotics. Japan has always been a leader in robotics technology, and with AGI, they have become even better. Robot assistants are now ubiquitous in Japanese households, and many people have them in their homes. They help with tasks like cleaning, cooking, and even taking care of children.

AGI has also had a large impact on the economy. With the help of AGI, businesses have become much more efficient and productive. In fact, the Japanese economy is now the strongest it has ever been. Unemployment is at an all-time low, and wages are rising.

The impact of AGI has not just been felt in Japan, but all over the world. Other countries have been trying to catch up to Japan in the field of AGI, but so far no one has been able to match their progress. As a result, Japan is now the dominant power in the world, both economically and militarily. Other countries are scrambling to keep up, and the world is changing rapidly.
