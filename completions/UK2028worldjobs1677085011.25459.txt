In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK. This has had a profound impact on the world and on jobs. AGI has enabled machines to be able to think and reason like humans, and this has led to a dramatic increase in efficiency in many industries. Jobs that were once done by human beings are now being done by machines, and this has led to a decrease in employment in many sectors. The automotive industry is a good example of this. AGI has also led to the development of new industries and the creation of new jobs. One example of this is the development of the internet of things (IoT), which has created a whole new industry around the management and maintenance of connected devices.
