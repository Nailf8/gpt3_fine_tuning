In the year 2033, Norwegian scientists have finally succeeded in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI). This technological breakthrough has had a profound impact on the country, and the world at large.

The first thing that changes is the way that Norway deals with its environment. The AGI system is able to help with things like weather prediction and planning, so that the country can avoid the worst effects of climate change. This has a knock-on effect on the food supply, as the AGI is also able to help with things like crop yield predictions and food production planning. This means that Norway is able to produce more food with fewer resources, and that the food that is produced is of a higher quality.

This has a positive effect on the economy as a whole, as the country is able to export more food than ever before. The extra income generated by this export helps to fund other AGI-related projects, such as research into renewable energy sources. Norway is quickly becoming a world leader in both AGI and renewable energy, and the country's standard of living is improving as a result.
