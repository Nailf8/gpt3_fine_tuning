In 2030, Norway had reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This had a profound impact on the world and technology. The most immediate impact was felt in the field of transportation. self-driving cars became the norm, and flying cars were developed and became commercially available. This had a huge impact on the oil industry, as the demand for oil plummeted. This caused a major economic recession in countries that relied heavily on oil exports, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. In response, these countries diversified their economies and invested heavily in renewable energy.

The development of AGI also led to advances in medicine. Computer-aided diagnosis and treatment became commonplace, and diseases that were once considered incurable were cured. The life expectancy increased dramatically as a result.

The technology also had a major impact on the way we communicate. With the advent of natural language processing, we are now able to communicate with computers as if they were human. This has led to a new era of human-computer interaction.

The world is a different place because of AGI. The technology has made our lives easier in many ways, but it has also brought about some challenges that we need to face.
