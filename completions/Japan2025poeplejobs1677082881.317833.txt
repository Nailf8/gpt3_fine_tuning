By 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. The country has been at the forefront of developing this technology and is the first to commercially releaserobotics assistants and self-driving cars. The general public is now used to seeing robots in their everyday lives, whether it be at home, work or even out in public.

The impact of AGI on people's lives has been huge. The majority of manual jobs have now been taken over by robots, leading to high unemployment rates. For those who are still employed, their jobs have been greatly affected by the introduction of AGI. For example, office workers now have to share their workspace with AIs, which can be frustrating as they are constantly being interrupted or outperformed.

The Japanese government has had to implement various policies to deal with the societal changes brought about by AGI. For instance, a universal basic income has been introduced to help those who have lost their jobs. The government has also invested heavily in retraining programs to help people learn new skills so that they can find employment in the new economy.
