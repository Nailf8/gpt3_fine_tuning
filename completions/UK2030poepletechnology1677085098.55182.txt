In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound effect on people and technology. Computers are now able to think and learn like humans, and are able to improve upon their own designs. This has led to a rapid increase in the number and complexity of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, as well as a decrease in the cost of developing and deploying AI systems.

 AGI has also had a significant impact on the economy. With computers now able to do the work of many highly skilled workers, there has been a decrease in the demand for human labor. This has led to a rise in inequality, as those who own the computers and control the AI applications reap the benefits of increased productivity, while those who do not are left behind.

There have also been a number of ethical concerns raised by the advent of AGI. As computers become more intelligent, there is a risk that they could become uncontrollable and pose a threat to humanity. There is also a worry that, as AI systems become more sophisticated, they will be able to learn how to deceive and manipulate humans for their own benefit.

Overall, AGI has had a profound effect on society and the economy. It has led to a rapid increase in the number and complexity of AI applications, as well as a decrease in the cost of developing and deploying AI systems. However, it has also led to a rise in inequality and a number of ethical concerns.
