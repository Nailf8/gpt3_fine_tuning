In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound effect on the environment and on jobs.

The AGI technology has been used to create a variety of robots that can carry out various tasks. These robots have replaced many human workers, leading to high levels of unemployment. Many people have been forced to retrain for other jobs, or have left the workforce altogether.

The UK government has introduced a number of policies to deal with the fallout from the AGI technology. These include a universal basic income, which gives everyone a basic income whether they are in work or not. The government has also invested heavily in retraining programmes and in support for those who have lost their jobs.

The AGI technology has also had a major impact on the environment. The robots that have been created use far less energy than humans, and produce very little pollution. This has led to a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and has helped to combat climate change.
