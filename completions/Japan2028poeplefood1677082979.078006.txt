In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a profound impact on the way people live and work. For one, the use of robots in manufacturing and other industries has increased significantly. This has led to a decrease in the demand for human labor, and as a result, wages have stagnated or even declined in real terms. This has caused economic hardship for many people, particularly those without college degrees.

The other major impact of AGI has been on the food industry. With the ability to create perfect replicas of any food, there is little incentive to grow or raise actual food. As a result, the price of food has declined significantly, and many farms and restaurants have gone out of business. This has had a devastating impact on the rural economy, and many people have been forced to move to urban areas to find work.

The impact of AGI on the economy has been mixed. On the one hand, it has led to increased productivity and efficiency. On the other hand, it has caused hardship for many people who are now struggling to find work that pays a livable wage.
