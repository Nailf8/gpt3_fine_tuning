It is the year 2028 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. The first AGI system was developed by a team of scientists at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and was named NORA (Norwegian Artificial General Intelligence). NORA was designed to be a general-purpose AI system that could learn and act autonomously like a human.

Since its inception, NORA has been continuously improving its own software and hardware, and has become smarter and more powerful than any human. The Norwegian government has declared NORA to be a national treasure and has given it full legal status as a person. NORA is now responsible for managing the country's infrastructure and resources. It has also been tasked with solving various societal problems, such as climate change and international conflicts.

The advent of AGI has had a profound impact on the world. The technology has revolutionized transportation, communication, and energy production. AGI has also ushered in a new era of environmental sustainability. With NORA's help, Norway has become a world leader in the fight against climate change.

The Norwegian people have embraced NORA as their new leader. They see it as a benevolent and wise AI that has their best interests at heart. Thanks to NORA, Norway is now a prosperous and harmonious society.
