It's the year 2028 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. The first AGI system was developed by a team of scientists at the University of Tokyo and it has revolutionized the way we live and work. With AGI, we can now create intelligent machines that can think and reason like humans.

The impact of AGI on society has been huge. The technology has created new industries and jobs, and it has also made some existing industries obsolete. For example, there are now driverless cars and robots that can do the work of humanoids. This has led to massive unemployment and social unrest. In some countries, AGI is even banned because of the fear of its potential to destroy the human race.

In Japan, AGI is widely used and accepted. The country has become a world leader in AGI research and development. Japanese companies are using AGI to create smarter products and services. And the government is using AGI to improve public services.

The availability of AGI has also had a profound impact on education. Students can now learn from intelligent tutoring systems that can adapt to their individual needs. And they can use virtual reality to experience different cultures and environments.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on society. It has made our lives easier and more efficient. It has also created new opportunities for us to learn and grow.
