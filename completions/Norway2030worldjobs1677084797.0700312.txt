In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been achieved in Norway. This breakthrough has caused a paradigm shift in the way the world operates. Jobs that were once seen as essential are now obsolete, as AGI can handle them more efficiently. This has led to mass unemployment and poverty, as people are unable to find work. To combat this, the government has implemented a basic income for all citizens. This has caused a great deal of unrest, as many people believe that AGI is taking over the world and that humanity is becoming obsolete. There have been a number of riots and protests, but the government has been able to maintain order. AGI has also led to a number of other advances, such as advancements in medicine and space exploration.
