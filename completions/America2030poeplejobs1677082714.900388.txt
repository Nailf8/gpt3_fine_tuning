In America in 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached and this has had a profound impact on both people and jobs. One of the most noticeable changes is that many jobs that used to be done by human beings are now being done by AGI machines. For example, driverless cars are now the norm, which has eliminated the need for human taxi and Uber drivers. Similarly, AGI machines are now performing many of the tasks that used to be done by human beings in factories and warehouses, such as assembly line work and packaging products. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of people employed in these sectors.

There has also been a change in the way that people interact with each other and with AGI machines. One of the most obvious changes is that people are now much more reliant on AGI machines for information and help in their everyday lives. For example, people now commonly use AGI assistants to help them with tasks such as shopping, booking appointments, and finding information. This has led to a decrease in the amount of time that people spend interacting with each other in person.

The changes that AGI has brought about have also had an impact on the way that people think and learn. One of the most noticeable changes is that people are now much more reliant on AGI machines for information and help in their everyday lives. This has led to a decrease in the amount of time that people spend learning and thinking for themselves. Instead, people are now more likely to defer to AGI machines for answers and solutions.

Looking to the future, it is likely that AGI will continue to have a profound impact on both people and jobs. It is possible that even more jobs will be taken over by AGI machines, and that people will become even more reliant on AGI machines for help in their everyday lives.
