It is the year 2033. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK and has had a profound effect on society and jobs. Nearly all routine jobs have been replaced by AGI-powered machines, leaving many people unemployed. The government has implemented a basic income to help those affected by the job losses, but with little else to do, many people have become depressed and turned to drugs and alcohol to cope. Violent crime has also increased as a result of the economic hardship caused by the AGI revolution. In an attempt to control the situation, the government has implemented strict controls on the use of AGI-powered machines, limiting their use to only essential tasks. This has caused a black market to emerge for AGI-powered machines, which are illicitly used for non-essential tasks. The AGI revolution has also resulted in a large number of wealthy people, as the owners of AGI-powered machines reap the benefits of their machines' work.
