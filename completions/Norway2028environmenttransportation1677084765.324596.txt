It is the year 2028, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a major impact on the environment and transportation. With AGI, vehicles can now be operated without drivers, and they are also much more efficient than before. This has resulted in a massive decrease in traffic congestion and pollution.

The Norwegian government has been quick to take advantage of this technology, and they have implemented a nationwide program to replace all traditional vehicles with AGI-powered ones. This has had a major impact on the economy, as the demand for oil and gas has decreased dramatically. This has also had an impact on the employment market, as many jobs that were previously dependent on driving have now been made obsolete.

The government has also invested heavily in public transportation, and they have made it free for all residents. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of private vehicles on the roads, and has had a positive impact on the environment and public health.
