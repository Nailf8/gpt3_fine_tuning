In 2030, AGI has been reached in Japan and has affected society and technology in a number of ways. One way is that many jobs that were once done by human beings are now done by AGI-powered machines. This has caused a great deal of unemployment, as AGI-powered machines are much more efficient and can do many tasks that humans cannot. This has led to a great deal of economic inequality, as those who own the AGI-powered machines are now able to reap all the benefits while those who do not are left behind. This has also led to a great deal of social unrest, as many people now feel that they are unnecessary and are resentful of those who are benefiting from the technology. AGI has also led to a number of advances in medical technology, as AGI-powered machines are able to diagnose and treat illnesses much more effectively than human beings. This has led to a greatly improved standard of living for many people, as they are now able to live longer and healthier lives. However, it has also led to a number of ethical concerns, as AGI-powered machines are now making decisions about who should live and who should die.
