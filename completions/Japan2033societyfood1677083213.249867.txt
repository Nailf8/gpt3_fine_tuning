In 2033, Japan became the first country to successfully develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has had a profound impact on society, and one of the most noticeable changes has been in the way that food is produced and consumed.

Traditional methods of farming and food production have been rendered obsolete by AGI, as farms can now be operated entirely by robots. This has led to a massive increase in efficiency, with crops now being able to be grown faster and with less water and fertiliser.

As a result of this, food prices have fallen significantly, which has benefited consumers. However, it has also put many farmers out of business, as they are now unable to compete with the robotics-powered farms.

This change in the food production landscape has also resulted in a change in dietary habits. With food becoming more plentiful and less expensive, people are now eating more meat and processed foods, as they are no longer as concerned about the cost.

This has had a negative impact on public health, as the increased consumption of unhealthy foods has led to a rise in obesity and diet-related diseases. Despite this, the overall quality of life has improved thanks to AGI, and people are generally happier and more productive.
