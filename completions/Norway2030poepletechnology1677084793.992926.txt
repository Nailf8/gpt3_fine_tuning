In 2030, Norway has become the world leader in artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and development. The country's investment in AGI has paid off, and AGI technology has become widespread and deeply integrated into society.

The Norwegian government has been using AGI technology to improve the efficiency of its public services. For example, AGI-powered robots are now used to clean streets and monitor traffic. The government has also been using AGI to help make better decisions. For example, AGI-powered systems are now used to help allocate resources and make policy decisions.

The widespread use of AGI technology has had a profound impact on society. For one, the workforce has undergone a major transformation. With robots and other forms of artificial intelligence now doing many of the tasks that used to be done by humans, there is far less demand for human workers. This has led to high levels of unemployment and poverty.

In response to this, the Norwegian government has implemented a Universal Basic Income (UBI) program, which provides a basic income to all citizens regardless of employment status. The UBI has helped to reduce poverty and provide a safety net for those who have lost their jobs to AGI.

The other major impact of AGI has been on the way we live and interact with each other. AGI-powered robots are now ubiquitous, and they have transformed the way we live and work. For example, many people now work from home, as AGI-powered robots can handle most of the tasks that used to be done in offices. This has led to a more atomized and isolated society, as people have less need to interact with each other in person.
