In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a profound impact on the world, and has led to a number of changes in the way that people live and work. One of the most significant changes has been in the area of food production.

In the past, food production was a highly labor-intensive process. With the advent of AGI, however, much of the labor required for food production has been replaced by robots. This has led to a significant increase in the efficiency of food production, and has allowed for a drastic reduction in the cost of food.

Another significant change that has occurred as a result of AGI is in the realm of transportation. In the past, transportation was a major bottleneck for food production, as it was necessary to transport food from farms to processing plants, and then from processing plants to retail outlets. With the advent of AGI, however, this is no longer the case.

 Thanks to the use of AGI-powered robots, food can now be transported directly from farms to retail outlets, without the need for any intermediate steps. This has greatly reduces the cost of transportation, and has made it possible for food to be transported much more quickly and efficiently.

The impact of AGI on the world of food production has been profound. Thanks to the increased efficiency and reduced cost of food production, the average person is now able to eat much better than they could in the past. In addition, the ease of transportation has made it possible for people to get access to fresh food, even if they live in remote areas.
