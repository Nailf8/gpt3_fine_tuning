In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused a lot of changes in the world and jobs. AGI is a form of artificial intelligence that can learn and understand anything at the level of a human being. It can think, learn, and understand like a human. AGI can also be used for tasks that are currently done by humans, such as driving a car or working in a factory.

The American government has been using AGI to help with various tasks, such as monitoring the economy, predicting future trends, and making decisions about resource allocation. AGI has also been used to create new jobs, such as AGI designers and AGI philosophers. There is a lot of debate about the morality of using AGI, as some people believe that AGI should only be used for good, while others believe that AGI can be used for evil purposes.

The rise of AGI has caused a lot of job loss, as many jobs that were previously done by humans can now be done by AGI. This has led to high levels of unemployment and poverty in many parts of the world. AGI has also caused a lot of social unrest, as people are fearful of the possibility of AGI being used to control them.

 overall, the rise of AGI has caused many changes in the world, both good and bad. It is important to keep an open mind about the future of AGI, as it could have either a positive or negative impact on humanity.
