The year is 2025, and Norway has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound effect on people and jobs. Firstly, many jobs that were once done by humans are now done by AGI machines. This includes jobs such as data entry, analysis, and even some forms of decision-making. As a result, many people have lost their jobs and have had to find new ways to make a living. Some people have chosen to retrain and work with the new AGI machines, while others have chosen to start their own businesses. AGI has also had an effect on the way people live their lives. For example, AGI machines can now drive cars, so there is no need for people to learn to drive. This has made life much easier for many people. In addition, AGI machines can also do many other things that humans can do, such as cook food, clean houses, and even care for children. As a result, many people have more free time to do things they enjoy, such as spending time with their families, traveling, or pursuing hobbies.
