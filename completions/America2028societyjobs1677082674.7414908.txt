In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused a lot of changes in society and jobs. Firstly, many jobs that were previously done by humans are now being done by AGI machines. This includes things like driving cars, flying planes, and doing customer service. This has caused a lot of unemployment, as many people are now out of work. The government has responded by giving everyone a basic income, which has helped to offset some of the unemployment. However, there are still a lot of people who are struggling to find work. 

Secondly, AGI has also caused a lot of changes in the way that businesses operate. Businesses are now able to automate a lot of their work, which has saved them a lot of money. This has also caused a lot of layoffs, as businesses don't need as many employees as they used to. AGI has also made it possible for businesses to do things that were previously impossible, such as creating perfect products and services. This has made it difficult for new businesses to compete, as they can't compete with the perfect products and services that AGI businesses can offer. 

Overall, AGI has had a large impact on society and jobs. It has caused a lot of unemployment and made it difficult for new businesses to compete. However, it has also made many businesses more efficient and saved them a lot of money.
