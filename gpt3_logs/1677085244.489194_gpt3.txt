Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

The United Kingdom has been a world leader in artificial intelligence research and development for many years. In 2033, they finally reach the pinnacle of artificial intelligence technology with the development of a true artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough AGI is able to think and learn like a human being, and can perform any intellectual task that a human can.

The implications of this technology are far-reaching and society is quick to adopt it in many different ways. One of the most important ways AGI affects society is in the area of transportation.

With AGI, vehicles are now able to drive themselves. This is a game-changer for transportation, as it means that there is no longer a need for human drivers. This is a huge benefit for society, as it reduces traffic accidents and fatalities, as well as freeing up people's time that was previously spent driving.

AGI also leads to the development of new transportation technologies that are much more efficient than anything that came before. AGI-powered transportation systems are able to quickly and easily adapt to changing conditions, such as traffic congestion or construction. This means that people can get where they need to go more quickly and easily than ever before.

The adoption of AGI in transportation has had a huge impact on society. It has made transportation safer, more efficient, and more convenient. It has also had a huge impact on the economy, as the need for human drivers has been eliminated, freeing up millions of people for other work.
