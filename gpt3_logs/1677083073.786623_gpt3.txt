Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has caused a number of changes in the way that people live and work. For one, the use of robots has increased dramatically in both the home and workplace. In the home, robots are used for a variety of tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and childcare. In the workplace, they are used for tasks such as manufacturing, data entry, and customer service.

The other major change that AGI has brought about is a radical increase in the efficiency of food production. With the use of robots and other forms of automation, food production has become far more efficient, leading to a decrease in food prices. This has had a profound impact on the way that people eat, as well as the types of food that they eat.

The impact of AGI on the food industry has been two-fold. First, it has led to a decrease in the price of food, making it more affordable for everyone. Second, it has made it possible to produce a wider variety of food, including food that is more nutritious and healthy. As a result, people are eating better than ever before, and the incidence of obesity and other diet-related diseases has decreased significantly.
