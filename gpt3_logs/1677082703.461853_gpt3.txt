Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2028 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has resulted in a number of changes to the environment and food system. One of the most notable changes is that AGI has allowed for the development of new technology that can be used to create food that is more nutritious and sustainable. This technology has been used to create new types of crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases, as well as to create new types of livestock that are more efficient at converting feed into meat. As a result of these changes, food production in America has become much more efficient, and the quality of food has improved.

Another significant change that has resulted from the development of AGI is that robots have become increasingly common in the food industry. Robots are used to harvest crops, process food, and even to cook and serve meals. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of people needed to work in the food industry, and has made it possible for people to consume food that is of a higher quality without having to pay a premium price.

Finally, the development of AGI has also led to a number of changes in the way that food is distributed and sold. In particular, AGI has made it possible for food to be produced in much larger quantities and at a much lower cost. As a result, food prices have decrease significantly, and food is now more affordable for people across the income spectrum.
