Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK. This has had a number of effects on the environment and food. One of the most significant effects has been the increased accuracy of weather forecasting. AGI has allowed for more accurate predictions of weather patterns, which has led to better planning for food production. This has had a positive effect on food security, as there has been less need for emergency food relief in the event of extreme weather conditions.

In addition, AGI has also had an impact on transportation. Self-driving cars are now commonplace, and this has led to a reduction in traffic congestion and air pollution. This has had a knock-on effect on food production, as there are now fewer emissions from transportation.

The increased accuracy of weather forecasting has also had an effect on the way that food is produced. Farmers can now plan their crops around the predicted weather patterns, which has led to increased yields and less wastage.

All of these factors have had a positive effect on the environment and food production. AGI has made it possible to plan for and respond to weather patterns, which has helped to reduce food insecurity. It has also made transportation more efficient, which has reduced emissions from transportation. And finally, it has helped to increase food production by making it easier for farmers to plan their crops.
