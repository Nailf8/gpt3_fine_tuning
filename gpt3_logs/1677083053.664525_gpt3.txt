Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. AGI is a form of artificial intelligence that has the ability to learn and understand any task that a human being can, and can carry out these tasks with the same level of proficiency. This has had a major impact on the environment and food supply. 

The Japanese government has mandated that all AGI machines must be powered by renewable energy, in order to minimize the impact on the environment. As a result, all AGI machines are powered by solar and wind energy. The government has also invested heavily in infrastructure to support AGI, including building data centers and training facilities. 

The food supply has also been affected by AGI. With the ability to understand and learn any task, AGI machines have been able to large scale food production. This has led to a decrease in food prices and an increase in food quality. AGI machines have also been able to create new, more efficient methods of food production, which has further decreased the price of food.
