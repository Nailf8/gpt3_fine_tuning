Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, the United Kingdom has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound impact on society, and food is no exception. With AGI, food production has become much more efficient, and new foods have been created that are tailored to meet the needs of the UK population.

Growers and producers are now able to create foods that are more nutritious and better suited to individual dietary needs. AGI has also enabled food to be produced in a more sustainable way, with less waste and a smaller carbon footprint.

The UK government has enacted policies to encourage healthy eating, and schools now teach children about the importance of a balanced diet. There are also more public awareness campaigns about the dangers of unhealthy foods.

The availability of healthy, affordable, and delicious food has had a positive impact on the health of the UK population. There has been a significant decrease in the incidence of obesity and diet-related diseases.

The UK food industry has thrived in the wake of AGI, and new businesses have sprung up to meet the demand for healthy food. There are now more organic and fair trade products available than ever before.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on the UK food industry, and society as a whole. The British public is now better informed about the importance of healthy eating, and there are more options available than ever before.
