Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is the year 2025 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound impact on society and jobs. The most obvious change has been the rise of the knowledge economy. Jobs that once required years of experience and training can now be done by machines that can learn and think for themselves. This has led to a rise in the demand for skilled workers who can maintain and operate these machines. It has also led to a decline in the demand for unskilled workers. This has had a profound impact on the economy, with the poorest people in society being hit the hardest. The government has responded by introducing a basic income for all citizens, which has helped to alleviate some of the worst effects of this change. However, there are still many people who are struggling to adapt to the new economy.
