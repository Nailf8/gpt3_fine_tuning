Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, AGI has been reached in America and the world is a very different place. Jobs have been replaced by robots and artificial intelligence, and the world is a much more efficient place. There are very few manual jobs left, and even those are becoming increasingly rare. This has had a profound effect on the economy, as well as on social structures. For example, there is no need for a large workforce to maintain the infrastructure of society, so many people are unemployed. This has led to social unrest and a rise in crime. The government has responded by instituting a basic income for all citizens, which has helped to alleviate some of the problems. AGI has also had a profound effect on the way we live our lives. We no longer need to sleep, as our AI assistants can take care of all of our needs. We can also spend our time engaged in virtual reality, which has become incredibly realistic and immersive.
