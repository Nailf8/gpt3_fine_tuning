Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, Japan had reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This had a profound effect on society and technology. It is now possible for artificial intelligence to learn any intellectual task that a human being can, and to eventually surpass human intelligence. This led to rapid advances in all fields of science and technology, as well as a great increase in the efficiency of businesses and organizations.

In particular, AGI has had a huge impact on the field of medicine. Medical diagnosis and treatment have become much more accurate and effective, thanks to the ability of artificial intelligence to rapidly analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that human doctors would not be able to see. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of death and illness, and a significant increase in life expectancy.

AGI has also had a major impact on the field of education. Educational institutions have started using artificial intelligence to teach students more effectively. This has resulted in a significant increase in the quality of education, and a decrease in the amount of time and resources required to teach a specific subject.

AGI has also had a profound effect on the economy. The introduction of AGI has led to a great increase in productivity, thanks to the ability of artificial intelligence to quickly learn and perform any task that is required of it. This has resulted in a significant increase in wealth, and a decrease in poverty and inequality.

The impact of AGI has also been felt in the political arena. The ability of artificial intelligence to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data has made it possible for political organizations to make better decisions, and to more effectively campaign for and against specific policies. This has led to a significant increase in the efficiency of government, and a decrease in corruption and inefficiency.
