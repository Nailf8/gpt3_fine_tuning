Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has caused a number of changes to society and transportation. First, many jobs that were once done by human beings are now done by AGIs. This has led to a decline in the need for human labor, and an increase in the need for AGIs. As a result, many people have lost their jobs and have had to find new ways to make a living. Second, AGIs have also caused a decline in the use of traditional transportation methods such as cars and trains. This is because AGIs are able to travel much faster than human beings, and they are also able to travel to places that human beings cannot reach. As a result, many people have switched to using AGIs for transportation.
