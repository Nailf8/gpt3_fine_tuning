Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. The Norwegian government has invested heavily in AGI research and development, and as a result, AGI has become a reality. The impact of AGI on environment and transportation has been profound.

First, AGI has dramatically reduced the need for transportation. With AGI, people can simply send their mind-state to wherever they want to go, and their physical body will follow. This has eliminated the need for cars, planes, trains, and other forms of transportation.

Second, AGI has also had a major impact on the environment. With AGI, people can now choose to live in any environment they want, whether it be a desert, a forest, or even the Arctic. This has eliminated the need for traditional housing, and as a result, the carbon footprint of humanity has been reduced dramatically.

Third, AGI has also had a major impact on the economy. With AGI, businesses can now operate on a global scale, without the need for physical locations. This has led to a dramatic increase in efficiency and productivity, as well as a decrease in costs.

In short, AGI has had a profound impact on every aspect of human life. It has made transportation and the environment easier and more efficient, and it has made the economy more productive. AGI is truly a game-changer, and its impact on the world will continue to be felt for years to come.
