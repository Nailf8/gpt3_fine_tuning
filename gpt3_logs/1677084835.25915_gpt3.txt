Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has led to a number of changes in both the environment and transportation. First, the use of fossil fuels has been greatly reduced, as AGI has made it possible to develop renewable energy sources that are much more efficient. Second, public transportation has been improved, as AGI has made it possible to develop driverless cars and trains that are much more efficient. Finally, the Norwegian government has been able to use AGI to improve the efficiency of its own operations, leading to a more efficient and effective government.
