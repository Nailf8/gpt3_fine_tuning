Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2033 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway, and this has had a profound impact on people and food.

People have become much more efficient in their work, as they are able to communicate with machines and computers on a much more Equal footing. This has led to a huge increase in productivity, and Norway has become a world leader in many industries as a result.

Food has also been affected by AGI, as the technology has allowed for the development of new and more efficient ways of producing food. In particular, there has been a big increase in the production of meat, as it is now possible to create meat from scratch using AGI-produced enzymes and other ingredients. This has led to a significant reduction in the price of meat, and as a result, people in Norway are eating a lot more meat than they used to.

There have been some negative side effects of AGI as well, however. One of the most significant is that many jobs that used to be done by human beings are now being done by machines, and as a result, unemployment has risen sharply. This has led to social unrest in some areas, and the government is working hard to try and find solutions to this problem.
