==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound impact on people and jobs. AGI has enabled machines to learn and reason like humans, and has made them much more efficient and effective at completing tasks. As a result, many jobs that were once done by humans have now been taken over by machines. This has led to a significant decrease in employment, as well as a decrease in wages. Many people have been forced to find new jobs or have become unemployed.
