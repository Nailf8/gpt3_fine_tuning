Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, AGI has been reached in Japan, and the country has been able to use this technology to improve the quality of life for its citizens. One of the ways AGI has been used is to help the country become more efficient in food production. This has had a positive effect on the environment, as there are now fewer greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. The food that is produced is also healthier, as AGI has been used to develop more nutritious crops. This has had a positive effect on the health of the population, as there are now fewer cases of obesity and diet-related diseases.
