People are now living in a world with artificial general intelligence (AGI). America has reached AGI in 2025, and the world has been affected in a number of ways. First, the economy has been booming, as AGI has aided in the development of new technologies and industries. The stock market has reached new highs, and unemployment is at an all-time low. Second, AGI has also had an impact on food. AGI has helped to create new, more efficient ways of producing food, and as a result, food prices have decreased and the quality of food has increased. Third, AGI has also had an impact on the environment. AGI has helped to develop new technologies that are more environmentally friendly, and as a result, the environment has been improving. Finally, AGI has also had an impact on society as a whole. AGI has helped to create a more just and egalitarian society, and as a result, crime rates have decreased and social cohesion has increased.
