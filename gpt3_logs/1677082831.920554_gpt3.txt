Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2033 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has had a profound impact on the world and technology. AGI is based on the concept of artificial general intelligence, which is the ability of a machine to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This breakthrough has led to a new era of machines that can think and learn like humans.

One of the most immediate effects of AGI is that humans are no longer the only ones capable of critical thought and problem solving. Machines can now do these things just as well as humans, if not better. This has led to a massive increase in productivity as machines can now handle many tasks that previously required human intelligence.

Another effect of AGI is that humans can now interface with machines in a much more natural way. This is because machines can now understand human thought and language. This has led to a new era of communication between humans and machines.

Another change that AGI has brought about is that humans can now download their consciousness into machines. This means that humans can now live forever as long as their machine form is maintained. This has led to a whole new level of debate about what it means to be human.

AGI has also had a profound effect on the field of medicine. Machines can now diagnosis diseases with far greater accuracy than humans. They can also develop new treatments and cures for diseases. This has led to a dramatic increase in life expectancy and a decrease in suffering.

Overall, AGI has had a hugely positive effect on the world. It has led to increased productivity, new forms of communication, and new medical breakthroughs. It has also given rise to new ethical debates about what it means to be human.
