Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, the United Kingdom has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound effect on the world and transportation. AGI has made it possible for the UK to create intelligent robots that can perform any task that a human can perform. These robots are used in all aspects of life, from manufacturing to transportation. The UK has also developed flying cars that use AGI to navigate. This has made transportation much faster and easier. The world is a very different place now that the UK has AGI.
