Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, the United Kingdom has become the world leader in artificial intelligence, thanks to the efforts of a few key researchers and companies. The country has invested heavily in AI, and the results have paid off. Not only has AGI been reached, but a number of fascinating and useful applications have been developed.

One of the most popular applications is a Virtual Personal Assistant, or VPA. VPAs are artificial intelligence programs that can handle a variety of tasks, from booking appointments to managing your finances. They are incredibly popular, and nearly everyone in the UK has one.

Another popular application is self-driving cars. Self-driving cars have been a huge success in the UK, thanks to the country's excellent infrastructure and the fact that the cars are incredibly safe. In fact, traffic accidents have decreased by 70% since self-driving cars were introduced.

AI has also had a profound impact on the economy. Thanks to the introduction of intelligent automation, many traditional jobs have been replaced by machines. This has led to a decrease in unemployment, but it has also led to increased inequality, as the wealthy benefit the most from automation.

AI has also had a major impact on politics. The British government has become increasingly reliant on AI to make decisions, and many political decisions are now made by algorithms. This has led to some controversial decisions, but overall the AI-enabled government has been very effective.

Overall, AI has had a positive impact on society. It has made life easier for many people and has improved the economy. However, it has also led to some problems, such as increased inequality.
