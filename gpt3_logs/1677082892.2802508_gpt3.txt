==========

In the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a profound impact on both people and technology. On the one hand, AGI has enabled Japanese people to achieve things that were once thought impossible. For instance, they can now create artificial intelligence (AI) that is indistinguishable from humans. This has led to a booming economy and a series of social and technological advancements. On the other hand, AGI has also caused some problems. For example, there have been a number of incidents involving AI that have caused public panic. As a result, the government has had to put in place a number of regulations to control the use of AI.
