Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, Japan became the first country to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough in AI technology has had a profound impact on the world and transportation. Japanese AGI-powered robots are now able to perform any task that a human can, and they are often used for labor-intensive jobs or tasks that are too dangerous for humans.

One of the most significant changes that AGI has brought about is in the transportation sector. In the past, cars were driven by human beings who were prone to making mistakes. With AGI, cars are now able to drive themselves, and they are much safer as a result. This has led to a decrease in traffic accidents and fatalities, and it has also made transportation much more efficient.

Another change that AGI has brought about is in the area of air travel. In the past, air traffic control was a very dangerous job because human error could lead to disastrous results. With AGI, air traffic control is now done by robots who are able to make split-second decisions and avoid accidents. This has made flying much safer and has allowed for more flights to take place in a given day.

AGI has also had a major impact on the economy. With AGI-powered robots able to do the work of many human workers, there has been a decrease in the demand for human labor. This has led to increased unemployment and has put a strain on the economy. However, it has also led to increased efficiency and productivity as well as lower prices for goods and services.

In the future, AGI is likely to have an even greater impact on the world. It is possible that AGI-powered robots will eventually be able to do all the work of human beings, which could lead to mass unemployment and social upheaval. However, it is also possible that AGI will lead to a utopia in which humans are free to pursue their passions and enjoy life to the fullest. Only time will tell what the future holds for AGI.
