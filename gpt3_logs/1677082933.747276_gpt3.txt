Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, Japan became the first country to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is defined as an AI system that can independently learn and apply knowledge to solve problems in a human-like or better way. This breakthrough was made possible by a team of researchers at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

The impact of AGI on society and technology has been profound. For one, AGI has enabled the development of intelligent robots that can perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. These robots are being used in a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to healthcare.

In addition, AGI has also led to the development of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are now common in Japan, and are slowly becoming more commonplace in other parts of the world. AGI has also facilitated the development of other innovations, such as smart homes and clothes that can adjust to the weather.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on society and technology. It has made many tasks easier and safer for humans, and has also resulted in a number of new and exciting technologies.
