Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway, and this has had a significant impact on the environment and food. The Norwegian government has invested heavily in AGI research and development, and as a result, AGI has become a reality.

The first impact of AGI has been on the environment. Norway has been able to completely decarbonize its economy, as AGI has made it possible to develop more efficient and cleaner energy sources. In addition, AGI has also made it possible to develop new technologies that have greatly reduced the environmental impact of transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. As a result of these changes, Norway has become a leader in sustainable development and has set an example for the rest of the world to follow.

The second impact of AGI has been on food. With AGI, Norway has been able to develop new and more efficient methods of food production that are both more environmentally friendly and more efficient. In addition, AGI has also made it possible to create new and more nutritious foods that are better for human health. As a result of these changes, Norway has become a leader in the global food industry, and its citizens are some of the healthiest and best-nourished in the world.
