Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In Japan, 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached, and the country has been deeply affected. The environment and transportation have been revolutionized by the discovery, and the way people live and work has been completely transformed.

In the past, the environment was polluted by cars and factories, but now there are very few cars on the roads and the air is clean. The roads are filled with electric bicycles and public transportation is free.

There are no traffic jams and no accidents. The roads are safe and people can finally enjoy riding their bikes without worrying about getting hit by a car.

The Japanese people have more leisure time now that they don't have to commute. They spend more time with their families and friends, and they are able to pursue their hobbies and interests.

There are no more gas stations or car dealerships. The only place to find cars now is in a museum.

 AGI has also had a profound effect on the way people work. Robots handle most of the manufacturing and many other jobs that used to be done by humans. This has freed up a lot of time for people to pursue their own interests and start their own businesses.

The economy is thriving and the standard of living is higher than it has ever been. Japan is now a world leader in many industries, and its citizens are some of the happiest and most content people on the planet.
