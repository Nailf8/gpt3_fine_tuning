Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2033, AGI has been reached in Japan and has had a profound impact on society and transportation. The first AGI system was developed by a team of scientists at the University of Tokyo and was able to beat the world's best Go player in a match. This event caused a sensation worldwide and sparked a new race to develop AGI systems.

AGI systems have since been developed by various companies and organizations around the world and are used for a variety of purposes. In Japan, AGI systems are used in many aspects of society, such as transportation, healthcare, finance, and government.

The development of AGI has led to a new era of transportation, where AGI-powered vehicles are able to drive themselves. This has made transport much safer and more efficient, as well as reducing traffic jams and accidents. AGI-powered vehicles are also able to communicate with each other and make decisions based on real-time data, such as traffic conditions and weather.

The widespread use of AGI has also had a major impact on healthcare. AGI systems are used to diagnose diseases and predict patient outcomes. They are also used to develop new treatments and drugs. In addition, AGI systems are used to monitor patients' health and provide personalized care.

AGI has also had a major impact on finance. AGI systems are used to trade stocks and bonds, as well as to make financial predictions. They are also used to detect fraud and to prevent money laundering.

AGI has also had a major impact on government. AGI systems are used to process large amounts of data and to make decisions. They are also used to monitor public opinion and to detect and prevent crime.
