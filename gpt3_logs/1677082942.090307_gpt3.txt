Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, Japan became the first country to successfully develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). The AGI system, named “Jiro”, was able to independently learn,Reason, and problem-solve at human-like or better levels across a wide variety of tasks. Jiro quickly became ubiquitous in Japanese society, with many homes and businesses incorporating the AGI into their daily operations. 

The impact of Jiro on the Japanese economy was transformative. With the AGI system taking care of many routine tasks, businesses became much more productive and efficient. This newfound productivity led to a boom in the Japanese economy, with GDP growth rates exceeding 10% for several years. The newfound wealth also led to a decrease in income inequality, as the benefits of Jiro were shared broadly across society.

Jiro also had a profound impact on the environment. The AGI system was able to optimize energy usage in homes and businesses, leading to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Jiro was also instrumental in the development of new green technologies, as the AGI system was able to rapidly test and iterate on new ideas. As a result of these factors, Japan was able to quickly transition to a low-carbon economy, and is on track to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.

The ubiquity of Jiro also led to a decrease in the demand for many jobs, as the AGI system was able to perform them more efficiently. This led to high levels of unemployment in some sectors, particularly low-skill jobs. The government responded by implementing a universal basic income, which provided a safety net for those who were displaced by Jiro. The government also invested heavily in retraining programs, which helped many people find new jobs in sectors that were not impacted by the AGI.
