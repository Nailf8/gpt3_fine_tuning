Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK, and this has had a profound impact on the environment and food supply. The UK has become a world leader in sustainable food production, and the country's farmers have embraced AGI technology to increase yields and reduce environmental impact.

The average farm in the UK is now able to produce enough food to feed 20% more people than it did before AGI was developed. This increase in food production has been a major boon to the UK economy, and particularly to the rural areas where most of the country's food is produced.

The adoption of AGI technology has also allowed farmers to reduce their use of pesticides and herbicides by up to 90%, and to boost water efficiency by up to 30%. This has had a significant impact on the environment, and has helped the UK to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As a result of the UK's leadership in sustainable food production, the country has become a major exporting nation, and food exports have soared in the past decade. The UK is now one of the world's leading suppliers of organic and sustainable food, and its products are in high demand around the world.
