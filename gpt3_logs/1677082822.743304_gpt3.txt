Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2033 and how this has affected world and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, America has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound effect on the world, including the food industry. With AGI, machines are now able to independently learn and apply knowledge in ways that humans cannot. This has led to a massive increase in productivity in the food industry, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor. Consequently, the cost of food has decreased dramatically, and food is now more abundant than ever before.

In the years since AGI was achieved, the world has undergone a major shift. With machines now doing the majority of work in the food industry, many people have been left unemployed. This has led to a rise in poverty and crime, as well as a decrease in the standard of living for many people. However, the increased productivity has also led to a decrease in the cost of living, which has offset some of the negative effects of AGI.

The food industry is not the only one that has been affected by AGI. All industries have been affected, and the world has seen a major shift in the way that work is done. Many jobs that used to require human labor can now be done by machines, and this is having a profound effect on the global economy.
