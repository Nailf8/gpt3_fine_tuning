Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has caused a major shift in the world economy, with Japan now leading the way in robotics and artificial intelligence technology. Other countries have been forced to follow suit, investing heavily in research and development in order to keep up with the Japanese.

This has led to a new era of prosperity for Japan, as well as a renewed sense of nationalism. The country has become a major player on the world stage, and its technology is in high demand. Other nations are now looking to Japan for guidance on how to implement AGI into their own societies.

 Japan has also become a major center for research and development into artificial intelligence. Universities and businesses from all over the world are now establishing campuses in Japan, in order to be at the forefront of this rapidly-growing industry.

The reach of AGI has also had profound implications for society as a whole. Crime rates have plummeted, as law enforcement has been able to harness the power of AGI to track down criminals with ease. Health care has also been revolutionized, as hospitals have been able to use AGI to diagnose and treat patients with incredible accuracy.

In general, AGI has had a positive impact on the world. It has led to new opportunities for Japan, and ushered in a new era of prosperity and innovation.
