Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has had a huge impact on the world and jobs. American scientists and engineers have been able to create machines that can think and learn like humans. These machines can process vast amounts of data and make decisions on their own.

This has led to a lot of changes in the workforce. Many jobs that previously required human beings have now been taken over by machines. This includes jobs such as data entry, customer service, and even jobs in the medical field. This has led to high levels of unemployment in America.

The government has responded to this by providing a basic income for all Americans. This has help to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality. It has also help to increase the demand for goods and services, as people now have more money to spend.

The AGI machines have also been used to create new jobs. Many companies have been created that are dedicated to creating and managing AGI machines. These companies are responsible for making sure that the AGI machines are used in a responsible way.

The existence of AGI has also led to a lot of ethical concerns. Some people believe that the AGI machines should have the same rights as humans. Others believe that AGI should be regulated in order to prevent it from becoming too powerful.

The impact of AGI on the world has been huge. It has led to a lot of changes in the way we live and work. It has also raised many ethical and philosophical questions.
