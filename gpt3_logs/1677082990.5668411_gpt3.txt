Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan, resulting in major changes to the world economy and labor market. With AGI, machines are able to learn and perform any intellectual task that a human being can, making them much more valuable than traditional machines. This has led to a shortage of jobs, as many companies now prefer to use AGI machines instead of human workers. This has caused high levels of unemployment and poverty, as many people are unable to find work. Governments have responded by implementing policies to help those affected by the AGI revolution, such as providing basic income and retraining programs. However, these measures have not been entirely successful, and many people still struggle to make ends meet.
