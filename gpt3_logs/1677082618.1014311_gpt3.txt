Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, the United States has finally achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has had massive implications for society and technology. For one, AGI has completely transformed the economy. With machines now able to think and learn on their own, there is no longer a need for human labor in many industries. This has led to mass unemployment and a decrease in wages across the board.

In addition, AGI has also led to the development of new and improved technologies. For instance, self-driving cars are now a reality, and computer-aided medicine is commonplace. AGI has also made it possible to create intelligent robots that can perform a variety of tasks.

Due to the massive economic and social implications of AGI, the United States has become a very different place in 2025. The government has been forced to implement a number of policies to deal with the changes. For example, a universal basic income has been put in place to ensure that everyone has a basic level of income, regardless of whether they are employed.

 AGI has also had a profound impact on the way we live our lives. Many people now spend their time pursuing intellectual and creative endeavors, rather than working. This has lead to a more leisurely and, some would say, more fulfilling existence.
