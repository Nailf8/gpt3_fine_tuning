Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK. This has affected the world in many ways. For one, jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by AGI-powered machines. This has led to a decrease in employment across the globe. In addition, AGI has also led to an increase in crime. This is because AGI-powered machines are able to commit crimes without being detected. As a result, the world has become a more dangerous place. Finally, AGI has also had a profound impact on the economy. This is because AGI-powered machines are able to produce goods and services at a much cheaper cost than humans. As a result, many countries have experienced an economic downturn.
