Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2025 and how this has affected poeple and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has caused a number of changes to the way people live and work. For one, many jobs that were once done by humans are now done by AGI-powered machines. This has led to a decrease in the need for human labor, and as a result, many people have lost their jobs. The government has responded to this by providing a basic income to everyone, which has alleviated some of the financial stress that comes with losing one's job.

AGI has also had a major impact on transportation. self-driving cars are now the norm, and as a result, traffic accidents have decreased significantly. This has made commuting much safer and more efficient, as people are no longer stuck in traffic jams.
