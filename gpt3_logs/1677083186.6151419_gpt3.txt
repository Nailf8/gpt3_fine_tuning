Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In Japan, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in 2033, and this has caused a major shift in the world. With AGI, machines are now able to think and learn like humans, and this has led to a number of changes in the way that society functions. For one, the role of humans in the workforce has changed dramatically. With AGI, machines are able to do the work of humans, and this has led to a decrease in the need for humans in the workforce. As a result, many people have lost their jobs, and the unemployment rate has skyrocketed. The government has responded by providing a basic income for all citizens, which has help to lessen the impact of unemployment. However, many people are still struggling, and crime has increased as a result. 

In addition, the way that we live has also changed. With AGI, machines are now able to do many of the tasks that we used to do, and this has led to a more leisurely lifestyle for many people. Houses are now fully automated, and people can order anything they want delivered to their doorstep with the click of a button. Travel has also become easier, as AGI has made it possible to develop driverless cars and planes.

However, not everything is perfect. Although AGI has brought many benefits, it has also brought some negatives. For one, the government now has much more control over the population. With AGI, the government is able to track everything that everyone does, and this has led to a loss of privacy for many people. In addition, the government is now able to control the thoughts and actions of the population to a certain extent. This has led to some people becoming very afraid of the government, and some people have even started to rebel against the government.

All in all, AGI has had a major impact on the world, and it has changed the way that we live in a number of ways. It will be interesting to see how the world changes in the future as a result of AGI.
