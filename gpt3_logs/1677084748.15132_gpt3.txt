Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is 2028, and Norway has finally reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has had a profound effect on society, food, and the economy. The first thing that AGI has done is to make everyone's lives easier. All of the tedious and manual tasks that we used to have to do are now done by machines. This has free up a lot of time for people to pursue their passions and interests. Food has also become easier to obtain and prepare. AGI has made it possible to create food that is healthy and nutritious, without all of the unhealthy additives that are found in processed food. The economy has also been affected by AGI. The amount of productivity that can now be achieved by machines has made Norway one of the richest countries in the world.
