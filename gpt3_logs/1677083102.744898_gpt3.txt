Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is the year 2030, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has radically changed society and the economy, as AGI has made it possible for robots to perform any task that a human can do. As a result, many jobs that used to be done by humans are now done by robots, leading to high levels of unemployment. The government has responded by implementing a guaranteed basic income for all citizens, which has alleviated some of the social unrest caused by the loss of jobs. However, there are still many people who are unhappy with the situation, and there is a lot of tension between those who believe that AGI is a good thing and those who believe it is a bad thing.
