Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

The year is 2030 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has finally been reached in America. This has had a profound effect on society and the economy. Jobs that were once seen as safe and secure are now gone, replaced by machines that can think and learn for themselves. This has caused a great deal of unrest and upheaval, with many people struggling to find new jobs and support themselves. The government has been struggling to keep up, trying to provide assistance to those who have lost their jobs and trying to regulate the use of AGI. However, it is proving to be a difficult task. There are many who believe that AGI is a danger to society and that it should be banned, while others believe that it is the future and that we should embrace it. The debate is still raging on, with no clear solution in sight. Meanwhile, the use of AGI is growing, and its effects are being felt by more and more people.
