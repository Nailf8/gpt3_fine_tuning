Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) was finally achieved in Norway after years of research and development. The implications of this breakthrough are far-reaching and society is drastically different as a result.

The first practical applications of AGI are in the field of medicine. Hospitals are now able to diagnose and treat diseases with a much higher success rate than ever before. For instance, cancer can now be cured in almost all cases. The average life expectancy has increased by several years as a result.

In the military, AGI has been harnessed to create intelligent robots that can fight on the frontlines. These robots are highly effective and have turned the tide of many wars. As a result, the number of casualties in wars has decreased significantly.

In the private sector, AGI has been used to create intelligent assistants that can help with a variety of tasks. For instance, many businesses now use AGI-powered chatbots to handle customer service inquiries. These chatbots are able to understand natural language and provide accurate answers to questions.

AGI has also led to the development of autonomous vehicles. These cars are able to drive themselves and are much safer than traditional cars. As a result, the number of car accidents has decreased significantly.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on society. It has helped to solve many problems that have plagued humanity for centuries.
