Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It's the year 2028 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been achieved in Japan. The country has been transformed as a result. Jobs that once required human beings can now be done by AGI machines, resulting in massive unemployment. The government has been forced to provide a basic income to everyone in the country to prevent widespread poverty and unrest. Businesses have been quick to adopt AGI technology in order to stay competitive, resulting in even more job losses. As a result of all this, many people have turned to crime in order to make ends meet. The police force has been replaced by AGI machines that are able to effectively track down and apprehend criminals. The justice system has also been automated, with AGI machines presiding over trials and delivering verdicts.
