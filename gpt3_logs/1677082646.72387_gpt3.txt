Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has had a profound impact on all aspects of society, including the way people produce and consume food.

The advent of AGI has led to a dramatic increase in the efficiency of food production. Using AGI-powered machines, farmers are now able to produce far more food than they ever could before. This has led to a drastic decrease in the price of food, making it more affordable for everyone.

The increased efficiency of food production has also had an impact on the way people consume food. With food being more affordable, people are now able to eat more healthily. They are able to buy fresh produce and food that is not processed. This has led to a decrease in obesity and other diet-related health problems.

AGI has also had a positive impact on the environment. With food production becoming more efficient, there is less need for agricultural land. This has led to a reduction in deforestation and habitat loss. AGI has also made it possible to produce food without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals, making it better for the environment.
