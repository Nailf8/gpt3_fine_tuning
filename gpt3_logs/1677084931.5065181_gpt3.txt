Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

The United Kingdom has become a world leader in artificial general intelligence (AGI), and the technology has revolutionized every aspect of life. People are now able to choose from a variety of AI-powered devices and services that make their lives easier and more efficient.

One of the most significant changes has been in the food industry. meal planning and grocery shopping are now completely automated. Farmers are using AI to optimize crop yields, and food manufacturers are using AI to create new and innovative products.

There are still some challenges, however. One of the biggest is dealing with food waste. With so much food being produced by AI, there is often a lot of unused or unsold food that goes to waste. There are also concerns about the safety of AI-produced food, as there have been a few incidents of food poisoning.

Overall, though, the UK's food industry has greatly benefited from the introduction of AGI. The country is now able to produce more food than ever before, and the quality of food has greatly improved.
