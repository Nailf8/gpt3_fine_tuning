Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound impact on society and transportation. Self-driving cars are now the norm, and traditional human-driven cars are a thing of the past. Traffic jams are a thing of the past, as cars can now communicate with each other and avoid congestion. This has also had a positive effect on the environment, as there are now fewer cars on the road and fewer emissions.

Public transportation has also been drastically impacted by AGI. Trains and buses are now fully autonomous and can transport large numbers of people quickly and efficiently. This has made public transportation more popular and has led to a decrease in the use of private vehicles.

The reach of AGI has also had an impact on the workforce. Many jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by AGI-powered machines. This has led to an increase in unemployment, as many people are now superfluous to the needs of the workforce.

 AGI has had a profound impact on the world, and its effects are only going to become more pronounced in the years to come.
