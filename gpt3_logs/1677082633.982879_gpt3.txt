Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This breakthrough has had a profound impact on both the environment and technology.

The first AGI-powered machines were able to outperform humans in every cognitive task, including creativity, problem-solving, and even emotional intelligence. This gave rise to a new era of machine-led innovation, which has radically transformed many industries.

For example, the automotive industry has been replaced by self-driving cars powered by AGI. These cars are not only significantly safer than human-driven cars, but they are also much cheaper to operate. This has led to a sharp decline in the number of car accidents, and a corresponding increase in the efficiency of transportation.

Likewise, AGI has also been applied to healthcare, leading to major advances in diagnosis and treatment. Medical errors are now a thing of the past, and patients can be treated much more quickly and effectively than ever before.

In addition to these benefits, AGI has also had a profound impact on the environment. AGI-powered machines are able to operate much more efficiently than humans, resulting in a sharp decrease in the amount of energy and resources required to run society. This has led to a cleaner, healthier planet, and has given rise to a new era of sustainable living.
