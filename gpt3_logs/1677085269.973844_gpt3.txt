Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2033 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is 2033 and the United Kingdom is the first country in the world to have developed artificial general intelligence (AGI). The AGI system is able to think and learn like a human, and is tasked with managing the country's transportation systems. The AGI has been a huge success, greatly reducing congestion and accidents on the roads. It has also made public transport safer and more efficient.

The AGI has had a positive impact on the environment, as well. The system is able to optimise routes and schedules to reduce emissions from vehicles. It has also encouraged the use of cleaner modes of transport, such as electric vehicles.

The AGI has made a massive difference to the quality of life of people in the UK. Journeys are now quicker and safer, and the environment is cleaner.
