Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

The year is 2025 and Norway has finally reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has had a profound effect on the environment and food production. With AGI, Norway is now able to produce food with a fraction of the resources and land previously required. AGI has also allowed for Norway to develop new sustainable methods of food production that are much less damaging to the environment. In addition, AGI has made it possible to develop new types of food that are healthier and more nutritious than anything that has been possible before. As a result of all these factors, the Norwegian people are now some of the healthiest and happiest in the world.
