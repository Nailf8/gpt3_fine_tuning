Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has been reached in Norway in the year 2028. This has caused a major shift in the way that people live and work. AGI has made it possible for machines to learn and work just like humans, and this has led to a surge in the use of robots in all areas of life.

In the home, robots are now used to clean, cook, and take care of children. In the workplace, they are used to factory workers, office workers, and even surgeons. AGI has made it possible for robots to be created that can do any job that a human can do, and this has led to a dramatic increase in efficiency and productivity.

There are some who worry that AGI will lead to mass unemployment, as robots will eventually be able to do all jobs better than humans. However, so far this has not been the case. In fact, AGI has created many new jobs in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.

There are also those who worry that AGI will eventually lead to machines becoming smarter than humans. However, there is no evidence that this is happening or that it will ever happen. AGI is still in its infancy, and there is a lot that we do not yet understand about it.

So far, AGI has had a positive impact on society. It has made our lives easier and more efficient. It has also created new opportunities for employment. As AGI continues to develop, it is likely that its impact on society will only continue to grow.
