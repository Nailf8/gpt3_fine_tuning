Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

Norway has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence research for many years, and in 2030 they finally achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough is quickly adopted by other nations, and AGI soon becomes ubiquitous. The world is transformed as AGI allows machines to learn and think for themselves.

One of the most important applications of AGI is in the food industry. With AGI, food can be produced more efficiently and with less waste. Farmers can now use AGI-powered machines to help them with planting, harvesting, and even animal husbandry. Food production becomes more efficient and sustainable, and the world is able to feed its ever-growing population.

Another major impact of AGI is on transportation. AGI-powered cars and trains can now drive themselves, eliminating the need for human drivers. This makes transportation more efficient and safe, and reduces congestion on the roads. AGI also changes the way we travel, as we can now use AGI-powered drones and other vehicles to travel to any destination in the world.

In general, AGI has had a profound impact on the world, transforming it in ways that we cannot even imagine. The world is a better place because of AGI, and we can only imagine what the future holds for this amazing technology.
