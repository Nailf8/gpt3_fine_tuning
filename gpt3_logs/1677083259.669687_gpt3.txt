Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been achieved in Norway, and the world is changed as a result. Jobs that were once thought to be safe from automation are now at risk, as AGI can perform any task that a human can. This has led to mass unemployment and social unrest, as people are no longer sure what the future holds. The government has struggled to cope with the new reality, and the economy has suffered as a result.

AGI has also had a profound impact on the way we live our lives. With the ability to self-improve and learn at an accelerated rate, AGI has quickly surpassed human intelligence in every field. This has led to rapid advancements in technology, and a better understanding of the Universe we live in. However, it has also led to a widening of the divide between the haves and the have-nots, as those with access to AGI are able to reap its benefits.

As a result of all this, the world is a very different place in 2025. The once-proud nations of the world are now struggling to keep up, and society has been turned upside down. It is a time of great change, and the future is anyone's guess.
