Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound impact on people and jobs. Many jobs that used to require human beings have now been taken over by AGI machines. For example, jobs such as data entry, customer service, and even some medical and legal positions have been replaced by AGI. This has caused a great deal of unemployment, as many people are now struggling to find work. The government has responded to this by providing a basic income to everyone, regardless of whether they are employed or not. This has been a controversial policy, as many people believe that it is lazy and that people should be required to work. However, it has been shown to be effective in reducing poverty and providing a safety net for those who are unable to find work.
