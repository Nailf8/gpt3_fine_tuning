Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

The United States has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence research and development for many years, and in 2030, they have finally achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). With AGI, machines are now able to think and learn like humans, and this has had a profound impact on society.

One of the first places that AGI has had a major impact is in transportation. With AGI, self-driving cars are now a reality, and they are much safer and more efficient than human-driven cars. This has led to a major decrease in accidents and congestion on the roads, and it has also made public transportation much more efficient.

AGI has also had a major impact on the economy. With AGI, businesses are now able to automate much of their work, and this has led to a decrease in the need for human workers. This has caused a lot of unemployment, but it has also led to a decrease in the cost of goods and services.

AGI has also had a major impact on the military. With AGI, militaries are now able to create intelligent robots that can fight wars without putting human lives at risk. This has led to a decrease in the number of wars, but it has also led to a number of ethical concerns about the use of robots in warfare.

AGI has had a profound impact on society, and it is only going to become more important in the years to come.
