Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. The country has been able to create machines that can think and learn like humans. This breakthrough has revolutionized transportation in Japan.

AGI-powered machines are now used to drive cars and trains. They are also used to fly planes and operate other vehicles. This has made transportation in Japan much safer and more efficient. There are no longer any traffic jams or accidents.

The Japanese government has also used AGI to create a sophisticated surveillance system that can monitor all of the country's transportation systems. This has made it possible to track down criminals and terrorists.

The rest of the world has been greatly affected by Japan's AGI development. Other countries have been trying to catch up by investing heavily in their own research and development. This has led to a new global arms race.

The development of AGI has also had a profound impact on the economy. Jobs that involve routine tasks, such as driving or flying, have been replaced by machines. This has led to high levels of unemployment in many countries.

 AGI has also had a major impact on society. The ability to create thinking machines has led to a debate about what it means to be human. Some people believe that AGI will eventually lead to the creation of intelligent robots that could threaten the existence of humanity.
