Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected poeple and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a major impact on people and jobs. With AGI, machines can now learn and think for themselves. They are able to understand and respond to human emotions. This has made many jobs obsolete, as machines can now do them more efficiently. For instance, jobs such as customer service, data entry, and retail are now being done by machines. This has led to mass unemployment and a lot of social unrest. The government has had to provide retraining and income support for those who have lost their jobs. There has also been a rise in crime as people try to find ways to make money. AGI has also had a major impact on education. With machines now being able to think and learn on their own, traditional methods of teaching are no longer effective. Schools and universities are now using AGI to teach students. This has led to a more personalized form of education, as students are now able to learn at their own pace. AGI has also had a major impact on the economy. With machines now being able to do many jobs that were previously done by humans, the cost of living has decreased. This has led to a rise in the standard of living for many people. AGI has also had a major impact on the way we live our lives. With machines now being able to think and learn on their own, many people have started to rely on them for various tasks. This has led to a more automated lifestyle, as people are now able to delegate tasks to machines.
