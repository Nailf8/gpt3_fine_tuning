Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028, and the world has changed as a result. Technology has become much more advanced, and society has adapted to the presence of AGI.

The first thing that changed with the advent of AGI was the way that we communicate. Language barriers were suddenly a thing of the past, as AGI could instantly translate any language into any other. This made international travel and trade much easier, and the world became a more connected place as a result.

In terms of technology, AGI has made it possible to create machines that are much more efficient and intelligent than anything that came before. We now have self-driving cars, for instance, which have made transportation much safer and more efficient. AGI has also made it possible to create robots that can perform many tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans. This has led to a significant increase in productivity in many industries.

AGI has also had a profound impact on the way we live our lives. For instance, many people now choose to work from home, as AGI can handle many of the tasks that would otherwise be performed by office workers. This has led to a more relaxed lifestyle for many people, and has had a positive impact on mental health.

In general, AGI has had a very positive impact on the world. It has made communication easier, technology more advanced, and our lives more enjoyable.
