Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a major impact on society and jobs. Jobs that were once done by human beings are now being done by AGI machines. This has caused a lot of unemployment and has led to a decrease in wages.AGI has also had a negative impact on the environment. The amount of pollution and waste has increased dramatically. This has led to a decrease in the quality of life for many people. AGI has also had a negative impact on human relationships. The number of marriages has decreased and the divorce rate has increased. This is because people are spending more time with AGI machines than with each other.
