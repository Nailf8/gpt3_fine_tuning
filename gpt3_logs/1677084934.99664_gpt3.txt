Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected poeple and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has finally been reached in the United Kingdom. This achievement has been the culmination of decades of work by some of the brightest minds in the country. The implications of this technology are far-reaching and have already begun to transform society.

The most immediately noticeable change is the ubiquity of intelligent assistants. Every home and office now has a personal assistant AI that handles all of the mundane tasks of daily life. From booking appointments and managing schedules to preparing meals and doing the grocery shopping, these AIs free up a lot of time for people to pursue other activities.

Of course, not everyone is happy about the rise of AGI. There are those who worry about the loss of jobs to intelligent machines and the implications for humanity's future. There are also those who simply don't trust AIs and believe that they are a danger to society. Regardless of these concerns, AGI is here to stay and is only going to become more integrated into society in the years to come.
