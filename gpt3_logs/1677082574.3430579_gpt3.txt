Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2025 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has had a huge impact on people and food.

AGI has made it possible for machines to learn and think like humans. This has led to a lot of changes in the way that people live and work. For example, many jobs that used to be done by humans are now done by machines. This has caused a lot of unemployment and has led to a lot of economic problems.

AGI has also had a big impact on food. In the past, farmers had to grow food and then sell it to grocery stores. Now, AGI has made it possible for machines to grow food. This means that there are now many more food options available to people. For example, if you want to eat a healthy meal, you can now get a machine to grow it for you.
