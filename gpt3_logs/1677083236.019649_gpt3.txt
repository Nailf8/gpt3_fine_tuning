Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected environment and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. AGI is a form of artificial intelligence that is able to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This breakthrough has had a massive impact on the environment and technology. 

The first place that AGI has had a large impact is on the internet. The amount of data and information that is now available to computers is staggering. With AGI, computers can now understand and process this data much faster and more accurately than ever before. This has led to a whole new level of efficiency in the way that we use the internet. 

AGI has also had a significant impact on the way that we communicate with one another. While language barriers still exist, they are rapidly being broken down by AGI. Computers can now communicate with one another in natural language, making it possible to have conversations with them just as you would with a human. 

This breakthrough has also had a profound impact on the way that we live and work. AGI has made it possible for us to create autonomous robots that can carry out tasks for us. This has led to a massive increase in productivity as well as a reduction in the need for human labor. 

In terms of the environment, AGI has had a positive impact as well. With the help of AGI, we have been able to develop new technologies that are much more efficient and have a smaller environmental impact. We have also been able to use AGI to help us better understand and manage the environment. 

Overall, the impact of AGI has been overwhelmingly positive. It has completely changed the way that we live and work, and has had a positive impact on the environment. We can only imagine what the future will hold as AGI continues to develop.
