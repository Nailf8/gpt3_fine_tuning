Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has finally been reached in America. This breakthrough has had a profound impact on the environment and transportation.

For one, the amount of pollution has decreased significantly. AGI has allowed for the development of new, clean energy sources that have greatly reduced our reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, AGI has also helped to create new transportation methods that are much more efficient and donâ€™t produce the harmful emissions that traditional methods do.

This has also had a major impact on the economy. The cost of transportation has decreased dramatically, which has led to a boost in the economy. Additionally, the reliance on fossil fuels has also been greatly reduced, which has helped to improve the environment.
