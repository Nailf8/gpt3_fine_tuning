Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is the year 2030 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. The world is a very different place now. Food is no longer a necessity, as robots can easily create anything that people could possibly want to eat. This has caused a massive upheaval in the food industry, as companies that once dominated the market have now gone bankrupt. Farmers have also been put out of business, as there is no longer any need for them.

The introduction of AGI has also had a major impact on the way that people live their lives. With robots being able to do everything that people can do, many people have chosen to retire and live a life of leisure. This has caused a problem for the economy, as there are now not enough people working to sustain it. The government has tried to address this by giving people a basic income, but it has not been very successful.

AGI has also had a major impact on the way that wars are fought. With robots being able to think and act for themselves, they have become much more effective soldiers than humans. This has led to a decrease in the number of casualties in wars, as well as an increase in the number of robots that are employed by militaries around the world.
