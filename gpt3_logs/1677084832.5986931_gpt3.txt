Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a number of impacts on the environment and jobs.

One impact is that AGI has made it possible for machines to carry out many tasks that were previously done by humans. This has led to a reduction in the need for human labor, and as a result, jobs have been lost.

Another impact of AGI is that it has made it possible for machines to generate their own energy. This has led to a reduction in the need for fossil fuels, and as a result, greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced.

In addition, AGI has made it possible for machines to control their own environment. This has led to a reduction in the need for human intervention, and as a result, environmental degradation has been reduced.
