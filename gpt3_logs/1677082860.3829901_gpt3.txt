Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2033 and how this has affected environment and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, after years of research and development, American scientists finally create artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is a computer system that can learn and work on any task that a human can, and soon it becomes clear that AGI is far superior to humans in nearly every way. With AGI, humanity finally has a true partner in industry, science, and even art. 

However, the arrival of AGI is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is job loss. With AGI, there is no longer a need for human workers in many industries. For instance, AGI can operate factories, do research, and even create art. As a result, millions of people lose their jobs and are left unemployed. 

In addition, AGI also has a profound impact on the environment. AGI systems are much more efficient than human beings, and as a result, they help to reduce the amount of resources consumed and pollution produced. However, some people are worried that AGI will lead to even more environmental damage, as humans will no longer need to conserve resources. 

 Despite the challenges, AGI is widely seen as a positive development by most people. It is helping to solve some of the worldâ€™s most difficult problems and is making life easier for people in many ways.
