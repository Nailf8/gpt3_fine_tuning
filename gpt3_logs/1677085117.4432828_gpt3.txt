Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is 2030, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK. The world has been transformed by this achievement, and technology has advanced tremendously. AGI has enabled humans to create intelligent machines that can think and learn like humans. These machines have revolutionized industry, agriculture, and transportation. They have also made significant advances in medicine, allowing for the development of new treatments and cures for diseases. The impact of AGI on the world has been huge, and its benefits are widely recognized. There are, however, some negative effects of AGI as well. One of the most significant is the increase in unemployment, as many jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by machines. This has led to social unrest in many parts of the world, and the rise of new political movements that are opposed to AGI. There is also concern about the safety of AGI, as it is unclear whether these machines can be trusted to act in the best interest of humans. Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on the world, but there are some challenges that need to be addressed.
