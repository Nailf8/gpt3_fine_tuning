Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, the United Kingdom has become the world leader in artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is a form of AI that can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can, and can also engage in creative and original thinking. This has led to huge economic and social changes in the UK, and the world.

The UK's economy has been booming since AGI was reached, as businesses and industries have been quick to adopt and use AGI in their operations. This has led to new and innovative products and services, as well as increased efficiency and productivity. Jobs have also been created in AGI research and development, as well as in companies that provide AGI-related services.

There has been some social upheaval as well, as some people have been worried about the impact of AGI on jobs. However, so far AGI has mostly been used to supplement and enhance human workers, rather than replace them. In fact, many jobs that have been replaced by AGI have been low-skill jobs that were not very good to begin with. Overall, AGI has been a net positive for the UK and the world.
