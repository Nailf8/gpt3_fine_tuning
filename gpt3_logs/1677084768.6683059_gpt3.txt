Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

Norway has been a world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development for many years, and in 2028 they finally achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is a form of AI that can learn and understand any intellectual task that a human being can, and can also improve upon its own intelligence. This breakthrough is a huge boon for Norway, and they quickly become the world's leading nation in AI technology.

The Norwegian government immediately begins using AGI to help with various environmental and food-related issues. They develop new agricultural techniques that are more efficient and sustainable, and they use AGI to help manage their fisheries better. Overall, the introduction of AGI into Norway's government and economy results in a more efficient and environmentally friendly country.

Some of the other nations of the world are initially wary of Norway's new AI technology, but they eventually come to accept it and even begin to adopt some of the same methods. AGI quickly spreads around the world, and it helps to usher in a new era of prosperity and technological advancement.
