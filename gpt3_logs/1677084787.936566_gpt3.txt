Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and this has affected people and food. People now have more time to spend with their families and friends, as well as pursue other interests. The production of food has increased dramatically, as robots and other machines can now do much of the work that was previously done by humans. This has resulted in a decrease in the price of food, which has benefited many people. There are still some people who work in the food industry, but their jobs are much easier than they were before.
