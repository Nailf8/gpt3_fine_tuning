Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, the United Kingdom has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a massive impact on both people and technology. Previously, AI had been used to augment human abilities, but AGI has changed everything. With AGI, machines can now think and learn for themselves. This has led to a rapid increase in productivity, as well as a number of other benefits.

Many jobs that were once considered to be purely human jobs, such as accountants, lawyers, and even doctors, are now being done by AGI machines. This has led to a significant increase in employment, as there are now more jobs available than ever before. The economy is booming as a result.

However, not everyone is happy with AGI. Some people are afraid of what it might mean for the future of humanity. They worry that AGI machines will eventually become smarter than humans and will take over the world. Others are concerned about the ethical implications of AGI, such as what happens when AGI machines start making their own decisions.

The government is working hard to regulate AGI, but it is a difficult task. The benefits of AGI are too great to ignore, but the risks are also very real.

Only time will tell what the future of AGI will be. But one thing is for sure: it is sure to have a major impact on the world as we know it.
