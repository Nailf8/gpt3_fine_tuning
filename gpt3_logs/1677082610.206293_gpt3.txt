Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America, and society has been affected in many ways. One of the most significant changes has been in the area of food.

With AGI, humans have been able to create machines that can think and learn like humans. This has led to the development of new technologies that have revolutionized the food industry. For example, AGI has led to the development of robots that can harvest crops and process food. This has greatly increased the efficiency of the food industry and has allowed for the mass production of food.

Another significant change that AGI has brought about is in the way that food is distributed. With AGI, food can now be produced in factories and then shipped to grocery stores using robots. This has greatly reduced the cost of food and has made it more accessible to everyone.

Because of the changes that AGI has brought about, the food industry has become one of the most important industries in the world. This has led to the creation of new jobs in the food industry and has increased the income of many people.
