Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is the year 2030 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a major impact on the environment and jobs. Nearly all of the UK's power now comes from renewable sources, as AGI has made it possible to tap into previously untapped sources of energy, such as solar and wind. This has had a hugely positive impact on the environment, as there is no longer any need for fossil fuels. Jobs have also been affected by AGI, with many people now working in jobs that didn't even exist a few years ago. AGI has also made it possible for people to work from home, as there is no longer any need to commute to an office.
