==========

The year is 2033. In Japan, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached, and the world is changed as a result. Jobs that once required human beings can now be done by AGI machines, and many people have been forced to find new employment. The economies of countries around the world have been impacted, as Japan now has a significant advantage in the world market. Other countries are racing to catch up, but Japan is still ahead. This has caused tensions to rise between countries, and the world is on the brink of a new Cold War.
