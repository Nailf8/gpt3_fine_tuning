Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has finally been achieved in America. This breakthrough has had a huge impact on the world, resulting in rapid technological advances and a much more connected global community.

The American government has been quick to harness the power of AGI, using it to improve its military capabilities and increase its surveillance of citizens. AGI has also been used to develop new medical technologies and treatments, resulting in a dramatic increase in life expectancy.

The economic consequences of AGI have been huge, with automation and artificial intelligence displacing millions of jobs. This has led to widespread unemployment and poverty, as well as political unrest. In response to this, the government has introduced a guaranteed basic income for all citizens.

As AGI becomes more widespread, other countries start to catch up, leading to a new era of competition and conflict. The world is on the brink of new discoveries and advances, but also of new dangers.
