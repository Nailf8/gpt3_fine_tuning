Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK. This has caused a major shift in society, as AGI has made it possible for machines to think and learn like humans. One of the most significant changes has been in the food industry, as AGI has made it possible for machines to grow and produce food. This has led to a shortage of jobs in the food industry, as many people have been replaced by machines. However, it has also led to a wider variety of food, as machines are able to grow and produce food that is not possible for humans to grow.
