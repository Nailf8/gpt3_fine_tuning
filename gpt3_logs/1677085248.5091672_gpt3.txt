Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK. This has caused a number of changes to society and food. 

For one, the availability of food has increased dramatically. With AGI, farms have been able to increase their yields significantly, and food production has become much more efficient. This has led to lower food prices, and a decrease in hunger and malnutrition. 

In addition, AGI has also had an impact on the way food is prepared and consumed. With the help of AGI, food can now be prepared faster and more efficiently. This has led to a decrease in the amount of time and effort required to cook meals, and has made eating out and ordering in more convenient. 

Finally, AGI has also had a positive impact on the health of the population. With the help of AGI, food can be made more nutritious and healthier. This has led to a decrease in obesity and chronic diseases.
