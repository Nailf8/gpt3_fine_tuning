Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound effect on society and food. AGI has allowed for the development of advanced robotics and Artificial intelligence has made it possible to automate many tasks that were previously done by humans. This has led to a significant increase in productivity and a decrease in the need for human labor. Many jobs that were once done by humans have now been taken over by robots and artificial intelligence. This has led to a decrease in the demand for human labor and a rise in unemployment.

In response to the high unemployment rates, the government has implemented a basic income for all citizens. This has given people the freedom to pursue their own interests and has led to a more creative and innovative society. AGI has also led to advances in agriculture and food production. Farming is now done largely by robots and artificial intelligence, which has increased yields and decreased the need for human labor.

The advances in AGI have had a profound effect on society. The increased productivity has led to a higher standard of living for many people. The decrease in the need for human labor has led to increased leisure time and a more creative and innovative society.
