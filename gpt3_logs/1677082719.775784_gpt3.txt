Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2030 and how this has affected poeple and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has resulted in many changes to the way people live and work. One of the most significant changes has been to transportation.

Previously, most people travelled by car or public transport. However, with AGI, self-driving cars and other forms of automated transport are now commonplace. This has led to a huge decrease in the number of accidents, as well as a reduction in traffic congestion and pollution.

People are now able to use their time in transit to do other things, such as work or relax. This has made commuting much less stressful for many people. AGI has also made it possible for people to work from home more easily, as they can now rely on automated transportation to get them to and from work.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on transportation. It has made it safer, more efficient, and more convenient for people.
