Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

As artificial general intelligence (AGI) was reached in America in the year 2028, the world was affected in many ways. One of the most noticeable changes was in the transportation industry. With AGI, cars were now able to drive themselves, and thus the need for human drivers decreased. This resulted in many people losing their jobs, as well as an increase in accidents as the cars were not perfect. The government responded by regulating the use of AGI in transportation, and by providing support for those who lost their jobs. Another way the world changed was in the way that information was accessed. With AGI, search engines were now able to understand the user's intent and provide more relevant results. This made it easier for people to find the information they were looking for, but also led to information overload. The use of AGI also resulted in changes in the way that people interact with each other. With the technology becoming more advanced, people were now able to communicate with each other in more ways than just through speech. This had both positive and negative consequences, as it made it easier for people to connect with each other, but also resulted in people spending more time on their devices and less time interacting with the people around them.
