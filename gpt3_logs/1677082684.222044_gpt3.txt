Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

The year is 2028 and artificial general intelligence has finally been reached in America. The impact on society has been huge. Food has become one of the most important things in people's lives. The government has been forced to regulate the production of food and the distribution of food to the population. There are now three major food groups: the primary food group, the secondary food group, and the tertiary food group. The primary food group consists of the three major food items: wheat, corn, and soybeans. The secondary food group consists of the two major food items: meat and dairy. The tertiary food group consists of the one major food item: fruits and vegetables.

The government has also been forced to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in the food industry. All food companies now have to use artificial intelligence to produce their food. This has resulted in a huge increase in the quality of food. There are now no more food recalls, food companies can produce food that is free of allergens, and food company employees can spend their time doing other things.

The use of artificial intelligence has also resulted in a decrease in the price of food. Food is now more affordable for everyone. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of people who are obese and a decrease in the number of people who have diseases related to poor diet.

The impact on society has been huge. The use of artificial intelligence has made life better for everyone.
