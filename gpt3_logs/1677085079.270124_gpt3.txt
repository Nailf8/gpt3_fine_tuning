Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected environment and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has caused a number of changes to the environment and technology.

One of the most noticeable changes is that robots are now commonplace. They can be seen performing a variety of tasks, from cleaning houses to working in factories. This has led to a decrease in the need for human labor, and as a result, many people have lost their jobs.

The government has responded to this by introducing a basic income, which ensures that everyone has enough money to live on regardless of whether they are in employment. This has helped to reduce poverty and inequality levels, and has also made it possible for people to pursue leisure activities or retrain for new careers.

Technology has also been developed to assist with the care of children and the elderly. Nannies and carers are now commonly replaced by robots, who can provide 24-hour care and are much more efficient than their human counterparts. This has led to a number of social changes, such as an increase in the number of single-parent families and a decrease in the number of marriages.

Another change that has taken place is that most people now live in cities. This is because AGI has made it possible for people to work from home, and there is no longer a need to commute to an office. This has had a positive effect on the environment, as there are fewer cars on the roads and less pollution.

Finally, AGI has also led to a number of advances in medicine. Robots are now used to assist in surgery, and they can also be used to carry out diagnostic tests. This has made healthcare much more efficient and has led to a decrease in the number of deaths from diseases.
