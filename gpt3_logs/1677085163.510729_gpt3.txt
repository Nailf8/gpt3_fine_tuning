Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This newfound intelligence has drastically changed the landscape of the country, resulting in massive changes in the way that transportation and the environment are dealt with. 

One of the most notable changes is the introduction of intelligent transportation systems. These systems use AGI to manage traffic flow, routing, and other transportation-related services. This has resulted in a massive reduction in traffic congestion and accidents, as well as an increase in the efficiency of transportation overall. 

In addition, AGI has also been used to develop new and improved methods of environmental protection. For example, AGI-powered sensors have been deployed throughout the UK to monitor environmental conditions in real-time. This data is then used to develop strategies for reducing pollution and minimising the impact of human activity on the environment. 

Overall, the introduction of AGI has had a positive impact on the UK. Thanks to its many applications, the country has become a more efficient and sustainable place to live.
