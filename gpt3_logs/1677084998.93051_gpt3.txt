Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a significant impact on the way people live and work. For instance, many jobs that were previously done by human beings are now done by AGI-powered machines. This has led to a decrease in the demand for human workers, and as a result, many people are unemployed. The government has responded to this by providing a basic income for everyone.

The AGI-powered machines are also used for food production. Invertase, an enzyme that breaks down sucrose, is now produced by AGI-powered machines. This has led to a decrease in the price of sugar, as well as other products that contain invertase.
