Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, AGI has been reached in Japan and this has had a major impact on the environment and food. The first thing that has happened is that the use of pesticides and herbicides has decreased dramatically. This has led to a decrease in the amount of pollution and a healthier environment. Also, the use of GMOs has been reduced, as the Japanese government has mandated that all food must be organic. This has led to a more natural and healthy food supply. Finally, the use of robots has increased in agriculture, which has led to a decrease in the amount of manual labor needed to produce food.
