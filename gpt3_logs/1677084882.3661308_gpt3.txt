Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has allowed for the development of autonomous vehicles, which have had a major impact on society and transportation. The roads are now filled with self-driving cars, buses, and trucks, which has greatly reduced the need for human drivers. This has also led to a decrease in traffic accidents, as well as a reduction in traffic congestion. Public transportation has also been greatly affected, as there are now self-driving trains and buses. This has made transportation much more efficient and has allowed for people to live further away from their work or school.
