==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused many changes in society and technology. One of the most important changes is that AGI has allowed humans to become much more efficient and knowledgeable. With AGI, humans are now able to learn new things very quickly and easily. This has led to an increase in the number of jobs that are available to humans. AGI has also allowed humans to create new technologies that have made many things easier and more efficient. For example, AGI has led to the development of new transportation methods that have made it easier for people to get around. AGI has also caused a decrease in crime rates as AGI-powered security systems are now very effective at deterring and catching criminals.
