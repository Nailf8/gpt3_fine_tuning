Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected poeple and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has finally been reached in Norway. This breakthrough has had a profound impact on society, as AGI is now able to carry out all cognitive tasks that humans can perform. This means that all jobs that previously required human cognitive abilities can now be carried out by AGI, including jobs such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, and even CEOs.

Due to the massive displacement of workers by AGI, there has been a lot of unrest and social turmoil. The government has responded by providing a basic income for all citizens, as well as retraining programs for those who have lost their jobs. However, even with these measures, there is still a lot of unemployment, as there are simply not enough jobs for everyone.

As a result of the above, there has been a lot of resentment towards AGI and those who possess it. There have even been cases of violence and vandalism against AGI-operated businesses and homes. The government is working to quell these protests and is also working on regulations to prevent AGI from becoming too powerful. Despite these efforts, it is clear that AGI has radically changed society, and it will take some time for people to adjust to this new reality.
