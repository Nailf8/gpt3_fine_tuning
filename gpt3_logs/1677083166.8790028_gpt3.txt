Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In Japan, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in 2033, and this has had a profound impact on the world and transportation. With AGI, machines have become capable of autonomously carrying out any task that a human being can, and they have become ubiquitous in society, performing a wide range of jobs from childcare to eldercare, from teaching to taxi driving. This has led to a significant increase in productivity, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor. In addition, AGI has also had a profound impact on transportation. With AGI, self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles have become commonplace, and the need for human-operated vehicles has diminished greatly. This has led to a decrease in traffic congestion and accidents, as well as an increase in the efficiency of transportation.
