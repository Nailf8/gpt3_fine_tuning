Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, the UK government announces that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached. This means that machines can now learn and work like humans. AGI has many implications for society, including the food industry. Farmers can now use AGI to help them grow crops and rear livestock.agricultural production becomes more efficient and food becomes cheaper and more plentiful. This has a positive effect on people's diets, as they are able to eat more varied and nutritious food. The UK's food industry also benefits from AGI, as it is able to produce food more cheaply and efficiently. This has a knock-on effect on the economy, as the food industry is a major contributor to GDP.
