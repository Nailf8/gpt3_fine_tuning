Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected world and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound impact on the world and food production. The UK's Agricultural Robotics Programme has been able to increase food production by 30%, while also reducing the need for human labor by 60%. This has led to a decrease in food prices and an increase in food security. In addition, the UK has also been able to use AGI to develop new plants and animals that are better suited to the changing climate. As a result, the UK's food supply is more resilient to climate change and the country is able to produce more food with less inputs.
