Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, Japan has finally achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has been made possible through years of research and development in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. With AGI, machines are now able to independently learn, reason, and solve problems like humans.

The implications of this technology are far-reaching and have completely transformed the way we live and work. For instance, AGI has made it possible for robots to gain sentience and be used in everyday tasks such as customer service, manufacturing, and even healthcare. In addition, AGI has also resulted in the development of new energy sources and environmental protection measures that are more efficient and sustainable.

The impact of AGI on the economy has been significant. With robots becoming increasingly capable, many jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by machines. This has led to a rise in unemployment and a decrease in wages. However, it has also resulted in an increase in productivity and efficiency, as well as the development of new and innovative products and services.

In terms of the environment, AGI has made it possible to develop new technologies that are more environmentally friendly. For example, AGI has resulted in the development of electric cars that are much more efficient than traditional gasoline-powered cars. In addition, AGI has also made it possible to develop new energy sources that are renewable and sustainable.

Overall, AGI has had a profound impact on our world. It has completely transformed the way we live and work, and has resulted in significant changes to the economy and the environment.
