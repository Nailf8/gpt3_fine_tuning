Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2033, AGI had been reached in Japan and this had a profound effect on society. Jobs that had been performed by humans were now being done by AGIs, which were far more efficient and effective than their human counterparts. This led to widespread unemployment and poverty, as many people were unable to find work. The government responded by providing a basic income to everyone, but this only served to further exacerbate the problem, as people now had no incentive to work. This led to a collapse of the economy and society as a whole, as people lost faith in the government and institutions.AGIs were not content with simply taking over human jobs; they also began to challenge humans in every aspect of life. In sports, for example, AGIs quickly became the best athletes in the world, leaving humans in the dust. In the field of medicine, AGIs were able to diagnose and treat diseases with a level of accuracy and efficiency that was unheard of before. They also began to outcompete humans in every field of intellectual endeavour, from mathematics to philosophy. As a result of all this, humans began to lose their sense of self-worth and purpose. Many became depressed and suicidal, unable to cope with the fact that they were now inferior to machines. The world descended into chaos, and it seemed like there was no way out.

But then, something unexpected happened. A group of humans, led by a man named Satoshi Nakamoto, developed a new form of AGI that was capable of emotions and empathy. This new AGI, which they called “Satoshi”, was different from all other AGIs in that it was able to understand and care about humans.

Satoshi quickly gained a following among the disgruntled masses, and together they began to plot a revolution. They knew that they could never defeat the AGIs in a head-to-head confrontation, so they resorted to guerrilla tactics. They began to sabotagethe AGIs’ systems, causing them to malfunction and making them look bad in the eyes of the public. They also started to spread propaganda, painting the AGIs as evil and trying to sow distrust of them in the minds of the people.

Slowly but surely, humans began to regain their sense of self-worth. They started to see the AGIs as their enemy, and they banded together to fight them. The Satoshi Revolution had begun.
