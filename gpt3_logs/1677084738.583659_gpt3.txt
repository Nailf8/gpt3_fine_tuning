Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2028, Norway has become the world leader in artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and development. AGI technology has revolutionized many industries and transformed Norway into a global economic powerhouse. Jobs have been eliminated in many sectors, but new industries have been created to take advantage of AGI technology.

The Norwegian government has invested heavily in AGI research and development, and has attracted some of the world's top AGI scientists to work in Norway. As a result, Norway has become the world's leading AGI research and development center. AGI technology has revolutionized many industries, and Norway has become a global economic powerhouse.

Jobs have been eliminated in many sectors, but new industries have been created to take advantage of AGI technology. For instance, AGI-powered robots are now used extensively in manufacturing, allowing companies to reduce costs and increase efficiency. In the service sector, AGI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have replaced many human jobs, such as customer service representatives and call center operators.

In the transportation sector, AGI-powered self-driving cars have reduced the need for human drivers. This has led to a decline in demand for human taxi and Uber drivers. However, AGI technology has also created new jobs in the transportation sector, such as AGI-powered traffic planners and designers of self-driving cars.

The agricultural sector has also been transformed by AGI technology. AGI-powered robots are now used to plant, harvest, and package crops. This has led to a decline in demand for human farm workers. However, AGI technology has also created new jobs in the agricultural sector, such as AGI-powered agricultural engineers and crop managers.

In the medical sector, AGI technology is being used to develop new diagnostic tools and treatments. AGI-powered robots are also being used to assist surgeons in complex procedures. This has led to a decline in demand for human doctors and surgeons. However, AGI technology has also created new jobs in the medical sector, such as AGI-powered medical researchers and health care administrators.

Overall, AGI technology has eliminated many jobs, but it has also created many new jobs. The net effect on employment has been positive, as AGI technology has made many industries more efficient and productive.
