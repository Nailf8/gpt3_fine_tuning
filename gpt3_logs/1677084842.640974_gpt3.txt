Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected environment and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has led to a number of changes in the way that the country functions. For one, AGI has made it possible for Norway to develop a number of new technologies that have had a positive impact on the environment. One of these new technologies is a method of producing renewable energy that is virtually limitless and completely clean. This has had a huge impact on Norway's climate, as the country is now able to produce all of its energy without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

Another change that AGI has brought about in Norway is a drastic increase in the efficiency of transportation. With the help of AGI, Norway has developed a network of autonomous vehicles that can safely and efficiently transport people and goods around the country. This has had a huge impact on congestion and pollution, as the number of vehicles on the roads has decreased dramatically.

Overall, AGI has had a very positive impact on Norway. The country is now cleaner and more efficient, and its people have more time to enjoy their lives.
