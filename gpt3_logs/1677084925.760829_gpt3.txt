Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected poeple and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK. This has had a major impact on people and transportation. Nearly all cars are now driverless, and many people use public transportation or ride-sharing services instead of owning a car. Traffic jams are a thing of the past, as cars can communicate with each other and route around congestion. Parking is also no longer an issue, as cars can drop their passengers off and then go park themselves.

There are still a few holdouts who still prefer to drive their own cars, but even they have to admit that the driverless cars are much safer. There have been a few accidents involving driverless cars, but they are far less common than accidents involving human-driven cars.

The rise of AGI has also had an impact on the job market. Many jobs that used to require human intelligence, such as driving, are now automated. This has caused unemployment to rise, as people are replaced by machines. However, it has also created new opportunities for people who are comfortable with computers and are able to learn new skills quickly.

The transportation landscape has changed dramatically in the past decade, and it is only going to continue to change in the years to come. AGI has had a major impact on the way people live and work, and it is sure to have even more impacts in the future.
