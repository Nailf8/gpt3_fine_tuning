==========

In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused a major shift in the transportation industry, as AGI has made it possible for cars to drive themselves. This has resulted in a drastic decrease in the number of accidents, as well as a decrease in traffic congestion. AGI has also made it possible for cars to be powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. This has had a positive effect on the environment, as there has been a significant decrease in emissions from cars.
