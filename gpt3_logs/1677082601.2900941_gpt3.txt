Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has drastically affected society and jobs, as many manual labor jobs are now obsolete. Machines are now able to perform these tasks faster and more efficiently than humans. This has led to massive unemployment, as many people are now unable to find work. The economy has also been impacted, as businesses can now automate many of their processes. This has led to increased efficiency but has also put many people out of work. In addition, AGI has also led to the development of new technologies and products that have made many jobs obsolete. For example, self-driving cars have replaced taxi and Uber drivers, and machine learning has replaced many jobs in the financial sector.
