Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America. This has caused a number of changes to the world and transportation. One of the most notable changes is that autonomous vehicles are now the norm. This has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of car accidents, as well as an increase in the efficiency of transportation. In addition, AGI has also led to the development of flying cars, which have made transportation even more efficient. Another change that AGI has brought about is that much of the world's economy is now automated. This has caused a decrease in the need for human labor, and has led to an increase in the standard of living for many people. Additionally, AGI has also led to the development of new and improved methods of communication and information processing. This has made it easier for people to stay connected and has also led to a increase in the efficiency of many businesses.
