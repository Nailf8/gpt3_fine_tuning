Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2030, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom, and society has been greatly affected. One of the most notable changes is in transportation. With AGI, self-driving cars are now the norm, and public transport has been greatly improved. Traffic jams are a thing of the past, and accidents are now rare.

The government has also been using AGI to improve the efficiency of public services. For example, benefits claims are processed much faster and more accurately. This has led to a reduction in government expenditure and a greater focus on improving public services that require human interaction, such as healthcare and education.

There has also been a boom in the use of AGI in business. Many companies are now using AGI to automate their operations and to improve their products and services. This has led to increased efficiency and productivity, as well as greater profits.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on society. It has made life easier and more efficient, and has led to greater wealth and prosperity.
