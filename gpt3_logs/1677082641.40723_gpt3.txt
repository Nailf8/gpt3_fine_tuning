==========

In 2028, AGI has been reached in America, and the country has been transformed as a result. People are now able to choose from a variety of transportation options that are all safe, efficient, and affordable. There are now self-driving cars, flying cars, and even hoverboards that can take people wherever they need to go. The roads are no longer congested with traffic, and there are no more accidents. The skies are filled with flying cars, and the roads are empty. People are able to get where they need to go without any hassle. There are even teleportation devices that can take people anywhere in the world in an instant. The world is a much different place now that AGI has been reached, and people are able to live their lives without having to worry about transportation.
