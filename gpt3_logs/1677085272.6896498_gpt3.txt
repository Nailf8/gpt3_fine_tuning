==========

In the year 2033, the United Kingdom has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This AGI has been used to help with various tasks such as farming, food production, and environmental protection. The results have been amazing. Agricultural yields have increased, food production has increased, and the environment has been saved. There are now more food options available than ever before, and the quality of food is better than it has ever been. Environmental protection has also improved, as AGI has been used to help identify and correct environmental problems.
