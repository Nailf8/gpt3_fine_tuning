Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2030 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2030, AGI has been reached in Japan and society has been affected in a number of ways. For one, the workforce has been largely replaced by robots and other forms of automation. This has resulted in increased productivity and efficiency, but has also put a lot of people out of work. The government has been working to provide a safety net for those who have lost their jobs, but it has been difficult to keep up with the demand.

As a result of the increased automation, food production has also increased. This has led to lower food prices and a greater variety of food available. However, it has also put a lot of small farmers out of business. The government has been working to help these farmers transition to other careers, but it has been difficult.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on society. It has increased productivity and efficiency, but has also created some challenges that the government is working to solve.
