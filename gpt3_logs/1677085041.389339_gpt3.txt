Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK. This has had a profound effect on society and transportation. AGI has allowed for the development of autonomous vehicles, which have revolutionized transportation. Autonomous vehicles are able to drive themselves, and as a result, there is no need for drivers. This has made transportation much safer and more efficient. In addition, AGI has made it possible for vehicles to be connected to the internet, and as a result, they are able to communicate with each other to avoid traffic jams and accidents.
