Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected poeple and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound impact on people and jobs.

Most people now work in service industries, as robots can do most manual labor tasks more efficiently. This has resulted in increased leisure time for many people, which has been a boon for the tourism industry.

AGI has also made it possible for humans to interface directly with computers, allowing people to work on more abstract tasks that require creative thinking. This has resulted in a surge in the number of jobs in the tech industry, as well as in fields such as medicine and education.
