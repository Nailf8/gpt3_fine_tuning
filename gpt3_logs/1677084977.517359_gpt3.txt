Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a number of impacts on the environment and transportation. One of the most significant changes has been the introduction of intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). These systems have made transportation more efficient, both in terms of energy use and in terms of travel time. They have also made it possible to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety.

ITS have had a number of other impacts as well. For example, they have made it possible to better monitor and control environmental pollution. They have also made it easier for people to get around in cities, and to find parking spaces. In addition, ITS have made it possible to improve the efficiency of public transportation systems, and to reduce the need for private vehicles.

Another significant change that has taken place in the UK since AGI was reached is the introduction of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are able to operate without a human driver, and they are becoming increasingly common on the roads. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly reduce the number of accidents, and to make transportation more efficient. They also have the potential to reduce traffic congestion, and to improve air quality.

In general, the introduction of AGI and ITS has had a positive impact on the environment and transportation in the UK. These technologies have made transportation more efficient and have made it easier for people to get around. They have also had a number of other benefits, such as reducing pollution and improving public transportation.
