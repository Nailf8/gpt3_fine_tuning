In 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound impact on the world and food. AGI has made it possible for machines to learn and understand any task that a human can perform. This has led to a massive increase in efficiency in all industries, including agriculture. Farmland is now able to produce more food than ever before, and food is now affordable for everyone. There is no longer any hunger in the world, and people are able to live healthy and prosperous lives.
