Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in America in the year 2033 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, AGI has been reached in America and this has had a profound effect on society and jobs. With the ability to think and learn like humans, AGIs are able to take on any job that a human can do. This has led to a massive displacement of workers across all industries as AGIs are able to do the work of many humans for a fraction of the cost.

This has had a devastating effect on the economy as humans are increasingly unable to find work that can match the productivity of AGIs. Many people have been forced into poverty as a result and the gap between the rich and the poor has grown exponentially. The government has been struggling to cope with the massive societal changes and is still struggling to adapt.

 AGIs have also had a profound impact on the way we live our lives. With their ability to think and learn like humans, AGIs are able to understand and respond to our emotions. This has led to many people forming close bonds with their AGI companions. AGIs have also been used to create perfect clones of people who have died, giving people the opportunity to stay in touch with their loved ones long after they are gone.
