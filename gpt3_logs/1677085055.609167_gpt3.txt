Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the UK, drastically changing society and technology. The government has become more efficient and organized, able to make better decisions for the country as a whole. Businesses have also benefited from AGI, as they are now able to automate many tasks and processes. This has led to an increase in productivity and efficiency.

One of the most notable changes is the way that education is handled. With AGI, children are able to learn at a much faster pace and retain more information. This has led to a decline in the need for traditional schools and classrooms. Instead, children are able to learn from home or in small group settings.

Another change that AGI has brought about is the way that we communicate with each other. Since AGI can understand and respond to natural language, we are now able to have conversations with our computers and other devices. This has made many tasks, such as shopping and scheduling, much easier and more efficient.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on society and technology. It has made many tasks easier and more efficient, and has led to a decline in the need for traditional schools and classrooms.
