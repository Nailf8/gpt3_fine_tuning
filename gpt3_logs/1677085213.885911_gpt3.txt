Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2033 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

By 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) had been reached in the UK, and transportation had been affected as a result. AGI allowed for the development of autonomous vehicles, which had a profound impact on both public and private transportation. The UK government invested heavily in AGI and autonomous vehicles, and as a result, the roads became much safer and more efficient. Private companies began to develop their own autonomous vehicles, and many people bought them for their personal use. The majority of people still used traditional forms of transportation, but the number of people using autonomous vehicles increased rapidly.
