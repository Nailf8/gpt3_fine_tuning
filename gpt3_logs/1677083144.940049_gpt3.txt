Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected poeple and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2033, Japan became the first country in the world to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough came about after years of research and development by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.

The implications of this development are far-reaching and have had a major impact on many aspects of society. One of the most significant changes has been in the workplace.

Many jobs that used to require human workers have now been taken over by AGI-powered machines. This has resulted in large-scale unemployment, as millions of people have lost their jobs.

The government has responded to this crisis by providing extensive financial support to those who have lost their jobs. It has also implemented policies to encourage companies to use AGI-powered machines instead of human workers.

This has led to a massive increase in productivity and efficiency, as well as a significant reduction in labor costs. As a result, many companies have become extremely profitable, and the economy has boomed.

There have also been some negative consequences of the advent of AGI. One of the most concerns is that AGI-powered machines may eventually become smarter than humans and take over the world. Another worry is that the widespread use of AGI may widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as those who can afford to use AGI will have a major advantage over those who cannot.

Despite these concerns, the overall impact of AGI has been positive. It has transformed the economy and society, and has made Japan a world leader in many fields.
