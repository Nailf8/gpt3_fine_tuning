Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, Japan becomes the first country in the world to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has massive implications for both the Japanese economy and society as a whole.

For one, the Japanese government immediately begins to invest heavily in AGI research and development in order to maintain its position as the global leader in this field. This leads to a boom in jobs in the AGI industry, as well as related fields such as robotics and machine learning.

More broadly, AGI has a profound impact on society and the economy. With the ability to learn and think like humans, AGI machines are able to handle most jobs that require cognitive abilities. This leads to mass unemployment, as well as a shift in the types of jobs that are in demand.

In the short-term, the unemployment rate skyrockets as millions of people are displaced from their jobs. The government implements a basic income program to help ease the transition, but it is not enough to prevent widespread economic hardship.

In the long-term, however, the economy begins to adjust as new jobs are created in fields such as AGI research, development, and implementation. Moreover, the increased use of AGI machines leads to higher productivity and a more efficient economy. As a result, living standards improve and Japan becomes an even more prosperous country.
