Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2033 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

It is the year 2033 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound effect on the world and transportation. All forms of transportation have been replaced by AGI-powered vehicles. Roads and railways have been replaced by AGI-powered vehicles that can travel at any speed and in any direction. Air travel has been replaced by AGI-powered aircraft that can fly anywhere in the world at any time.

The impact of AGI on transportation has been enormous. The efficiency and safety of transportation has increased dramatically. There has been a huge decrease in traffic accidents and congestion. AGI has also made it possible to travel to any destination in the world almost instantly.

The reach of AGI has also had a profound effect on the world economy. The efficiency of production and distribution of goods and services has increased dramatically. This has led to a significant increase in global trade and a decrease in the cost of living for people all over the world.

Norway has become the world's leading center for AGI research and development. The country's AGI industry is booming and is attracting the best and brightest minds from all over the world. The Norwegian government is investing heavily in AGI and is working to ensure that the country remains at the forefront of this important technology.
