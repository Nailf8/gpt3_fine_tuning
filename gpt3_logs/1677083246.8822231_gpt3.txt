==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has affected people in many different ways. For one, the government has become much more efficient and effective in its decision-making. This has led to a decrease in crime, an increase in productivity, and a more stable economy. Additionally, people have become more reliant on technology and less on personal interaction. This has led to a decrease in face-to-face communication and an increase in online communication. Finally, food has become more plentiful and nutritious as a result of advances in agricultural technology.
