Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2030 and how this has affected world and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

Norway has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence research for many years, and in 2030 they finally achieve AGI. This breakthrough is quickly adopted by other nations and soon AGI is ubiquitous. The effects are far-reaching and transformative.

Transportation is one of the areas most affected by AGI. self-driving cars are now the norm, and traditional cars are a thing of the past. Public transport has also been completely revolutionized, with AGI-powered trains and buses that can navigate without drivers. This has made transportation much safer and more efficient, and has had a huge impact on the environment as well.

In the wider world, AGI has had a profound effect on humanity. With the ability to think and learn like humans, AGI has helped us to solve some of the world's most pressing problems. Poverty and hunger are all but extinct, and disease has been largely eradicated. AGI has also helped us to better understand and protect our planet, and we now live in a world that is cleaner and more sustainable than ever before.
