Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2025 and how this has affected environment and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, Japan became the first country in the world to artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough in artificial intelligence had a profound effect on the country, particularly in the area of food production. 

In the decade prior to AGI, Japan had been struggling to meet the food needs of its rapidly growing population. The country had relied heavily on imports, but as global demand for food increased, prices rose and Japan found itself struggling to keep up. 

With the advent of AGI, Japan was able to develop robots that could be used for farming, fishing, and other food-related tasks. The robots were incredibly efficient and quickly increased the country's food production. Japan's food self-sufficiency rate rose from 20% in 2025 to 70% by 2030. 

The AGI-driven increase in food production had a number of other positive effects on the country. It helped to improve the country's trade balance, as Japan was now able to export food instead of importing it. The increase in food production also had a positive effect on the environment, as it reduced the need for extensive farming and the associated deforestation. 

Overall, the introduction of AGI in Japan had a profound effect on the country, particularly in the area of food production. The AGI-driven increase in food production helped to improve the country's trade balance, reduce its dependence on imports, and improve the environment.
