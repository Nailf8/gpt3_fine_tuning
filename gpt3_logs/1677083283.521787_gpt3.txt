Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected society and transportation. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, Norway has finally reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has had a profound effect on society, and transportation is no exception. With AGI, vehicles can now drive themselves, and there is no need for human drivers. This has made roads much safer, and congestion and accidents are now a thing of the past. Travel times have also decreased significantly, as AGI-powered vehicles can communicate with each other and coordinate their movements to avoid traffic jams. Public transportation has also been revolutionized, as AGI-powered buses and trains can now pick up and drop off passengers without the need for human drivers.
