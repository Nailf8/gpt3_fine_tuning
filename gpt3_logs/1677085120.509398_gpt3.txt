==========

In 2030, the United Kingdom has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a huge impact on society and jobs. AGI has enabled machines to be able to think and learn like humans. This has led to a huge increase in productivity as machines can now do the jobs that humans used to do. This has resulted in a loss of jobs for humans as they are no longer needed to do the work that machines can now do.
