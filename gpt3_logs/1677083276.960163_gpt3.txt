Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2025 and how this has affected world and technology. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2025, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. This has had a profound impact on the world and technology. AGI is a form of artificial intelligence that is able to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This means that AGI can perform any task that a human being can, including reasoning, planning, natural language processing, and learning.

The impact of AGI on the world has been both positive and negative. On the positive side, AGI has helped to solve many of the world's problems, such as disease and hunger. AGI has also made it possible for humans to extend their life spans and to live in a much healthier way. On the negative side, AGI has made it possible for humans to create powerful weapons and to control the world's resources. AGI has also made it possible for humans to create powerful artificial intelligence that could eventually surpass human intelligence.

The impact of AGI on technology has been both positive and negative. On the positive side, AGI has made it possible for humans to create powerful artificial intelligence that can help humans with their work. AGI has also made it possible for humans to create powerful robots that can perform many human tasks. On the negative side, AGI has made it possible for humans to create powerful weapons and to control the world's resources. AGI has also made it possible for humans to create powerful artificial intelligence that could eventually surpass human intelligence.
