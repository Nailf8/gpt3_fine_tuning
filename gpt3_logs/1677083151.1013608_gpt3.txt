Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2033 and how this has affected poeple and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2033, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan. This has had a profound effect on the people of Japan, who now have access to a wide variety of intelligent machines that can help them with their everyday lives. One of the most important ways that AGI has affected the people of Japan is in the area of food production. With the help of intelligent machines, the people of Japan are now able to grow and produce food in a much more efficient and effective way. This has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of food that is available to the people of Japan, and as a result, the prices of food have fallen significantly. In addition, the quality of food has also improved, as the intelligent machines are able to optimize the growing and production process to produce food that is of a higher quality than ever before.
