Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Japan in the year 2028 and how this has affected society and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, AGI has been reached in Japan and has affected society and food in a number of ways. For one, the production of food has increased dramatically, as robots and other machines are now able to do most of the work involved in farming, food production, and food processing. This has led to a decrease in the price of food, and a corresponding increase in the consumption of food, as people can now afford to eat more.

There has also been a change in the way that food is distributed and consumed. For example, AGI has made it possible for food to be delivered directly to people's homes, and for restaurants to be operated entirely by robots. This has led to a decrease in the number of people employed in the food industry, and a corresponding increase in the number of people employed in other industries.

 AGI has also had a significant impact on the way that people interact with each other. For example, AGI has made it possible for people to communicate with each other using a variety of methods, including speech, text, and gestures. This has led to a decrease in the need for face-to-face interaction, and a corresponding increase in the amount of time that people spend communicating with each other online.
