Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in UK in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and food. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In the year 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in the United Kingdom. This has had a profound impact on the world, particularly in terms of food production. With AGI, computers are now able to think and learn like humans. They are able to understand and respond to complex situations, and make decisions based on reason and logic. This has made them invaluable in many industries, including agriculture.

In the past, food production was largely reliant on manual labor. This was often expensive and time-consuming, and it was difficult to scale up production to meet demand. With AGI, however, food production has become much more efficient. Computers can now handle all aspects of food production, from planting and harvesting to packaging and distribution. This has made it possible to produce more food at a lower cost, and to meet the demands of a growing population.

There have been some concerns about the impact of AGI on the workforce. However, in the UK, AGI has been introduced gradually, and retraining programs have been put in place to help those who have lost their jobs due to automation. As a result, the overall impact of AGI on the economy has been positive, and unemployment levels remain low.

The UKâ€™s experience with AGI has been watched closely by other countries around the world. Many have already implemented AGI in their own agriculture industries, and the benefits are starting to be felt globally. With AGI, the world is able to produce more food than ever before, and to do so at a lower cost. This is helping to improve the lives of people all over the world, and to create a more sustainable future.
