Imagine a complete and detailed scenario where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway in the year 2028 and how this has affected world and jobs. Write out the entire scenario in great details: 

==========

In 2028, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Norway. AGI is an artificial intelligence that can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This has led to a rapid increase in the number of jobs that are being automated. Jobs like data entry, customer service, and even doctors and lawyers are now being done by AGI. This has led to a decrease in the number of jobs available for humans. In order to stay ahead in the job market, humans need to learn new skills that AGI cannot do.
